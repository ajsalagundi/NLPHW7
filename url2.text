Green Bay Packers receiver Davante Adams gave back to the high school that helped launch his football career.
With help from Wisconsin-based sports apparel supplier Eastbay, Adams surprised the football team at his alma mater in Palo Alto, California with new Jordan brand uniforms, cleats and shoes.
Adams said sports help unite communities and give kids an “escape” and an “outlet,” providing the basis for him helping out his high school.
“Having Davante come back and give back is something they’re going to remember the rest of their lives,” Palo Alto coach Nelson Gifford said.
Adams won a state championship with Palo Alto High School before becoming an All-American at Fresno State and a second-round draft pick of the Packers.
Adams, a four-time Pro Bowler with the Packers, became a brand representative of Jordan in May of last year. He enjoyed the finest season of his NFL career in 2020, catching 115 passes for 1,374 yards and 18 touchdowns over 14 games.

The Chiefs will join the Chicago Bears (twice), New Orleans Saints, Seattle Seahawks, Pittsburgh Steelers, Baltimore Ravens, Cleveland Browns, Los Angeles Rams and the Washington Football Team as playoff teams on the Packers' schedule in 2021.

Value isn’t there for Packers to keep DL Dean Lowry




Brandon Carwile 

March 31, 2021



The decision to extend defensive end Dean Lowry is still baffling. The Green Bay Packers believed Lowry could replace Mike Daniels, but his impact hasn’t been anywhere close. We are one month away from the NFL draft, and Lowry still hasn’t been cut even though he will count $6.3 million towards the cap in 2021. For that kind of money, the value just isn’t there to pay Lowry for what he does on defense.
When the Packers did their first wave of cuts at the beginning of the offseason, they parted ways with right tackle Rick Wagner and inside linebacker...

Murphy said the Packers were able to "create room with others," noting the contract restructures completed with six other veteran players to clear cap space earlier this month.
No veteran contract provided a bigger opportunity to clear cap space than Rodgers' deal, but...
