Former Green Bay Packers defensive back Morgan Burnett announced his retirement from the NFL in a post from his official Instagram account on Monday.
Burnett, 32, thanked teammates, coaches, and fans.
“Ups and downs, wins and losses, I’m grateful for every moment and thankful for every opportunity I got to step on a practice field and game field,” Burnett wrote. “I may be hanging the cleats up but I will always have love and respect for the game.”
Burnett, a third-round pick of the Packers in 2010, played eight seasons in Green Bay. He appeared in 102 regular-season games and 11 playoff games with the Packers.
Burnett intercepted nine passes, forced eight fumbles, defended 44 passes, produced 7.5 sacks, and tallied 698 total tackles (22 for losses) over his Packers career. He finished with 100 or more tackles in three different seasons (2011, 2012, 2014). In 2011, he set career highs for interceptions (three) and pass breakups (11).
After leaving Green Bay in 2017, Burnett finished his NFL career by playing in Pittsburgh (2018) and Cleveland (2019). He suffered a season-ending injury in 2019 and was not on a roster in 2020.
Former Packers general manager Ted Thompson traded up to take Burnett with the 71st overall pick in the 2010 draft. An immediate starter, Burnett played alongside Nick Collins at safety during the team’s first four games. He suffered an ACL injury and missed the rest of the season, but he still received a ring after the Packers went on to win Super Bowl XLV.
A tough and versatile player, Burnett played all over the defense for former coordinator Dom Capers, including snaps at linebacker.

Green Bay Packers receiver Davante Adams gave back to the high school that helped launch his football career.
With help from Wisconsin-based sports apparel supplier Eastbay, Adams surprised the football team at his alma mater in Palo Alto, California with new Jordan brand uniforms, cleats and shoes.
Adams said sports help unite communities and give kids an "escape" and an "outlet," providing the basis for him helping out his high school.
"Having Davante come back and give back is something they're going to remember the rest of their lives," Palo Alto coach Nelson Gifford said.

Packers will play 10 games against 2020 playoff teams in 2021

The addition of a 17th regular-season game in 2021 means the Green Bay Packers will play 10 games against 2020 playoff teams next season.
The AFC champion Kansas City Chiefs were added to the Packers' list of opponents as part of the NFL's expansion to 17 games. The Chiefs will join the Chicago Bears (twice), New Orleans Saints, Seattle Seahawks, Pittsburgh Steelers, Baltimore Ravens, Cleveland Browns, Los Angeles Rams and the Washington Football Team as playoff teams on the Packers' schedule in 2021.
Seven of the 10 teams finished above .500.

Value isn’t there for Packers to keep DL Dean Lowry




Brandon Carwile 

March 29, 2021



The decision to extend defensive end Dean Lowry is still baffling. The Green Bay Packers believed Lowry could replace Mike Daniels, but his impact hasn’t been anywhere close. We are one month away from the NFL draft, and Lowry still hasn’t been cut even though he will count $6.3 million towards the cap in 2021. For that kind of money, the value just isn’t there to pay Lowry for what he does on defense.
When the Packers did their first wave of cuts at the beginning of the offseason, they parted ways with right tackle Rick Wagner and inside linebacker...
