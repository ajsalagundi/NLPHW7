The addition of a 17th regular-season game in 2021 means the Green Bay Packers will play 10 games against 2020 playoff teams next season.
The AFC champion Kansas City Chiefs were added to the Packers’ list of opponents as part of the NFL’s expansion to 17 games. The Chiefs will join the Chicago Bears (twice), New Orleans Saints, Seattle Seahawks, Pittsburgh Steelers, Baltimore Ravens, Cleveland Browns, Los Angeles Rams and the Washington Football Team as playoff teams on the Packers’ schedule in 2021.
Seven of the 10 teams finished above .500.
The only NFC playoff team from last year that the Packers won’t face in next year’s regular season is the Super Bowl champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
Overall, Green Bay’s opponents had an overall record of 133-122-1 last season, giving the Packers the NFL’s eighth-hardest schedule by win percentage in 2021.
Of course, last season’s finish guarantees nothing about next year. Not all playoff teams from 2020 will make the postseason again in 2021. But the Packers’ schedule also features games against the Arizona Cardinals, San Francisco 49ers and Minnesota Vikings, three teams that didn’t make the postseason in 2020 but could rebound and be legit playoff contenders next season.
The Packers were 4-2 against playoff teams during the regular season in 2020, with wins over the Saints, Bears (twice) and Tennessee Titans and losses to the Buccaneers and Indianapolis Colts. The Packers beat the Rams and lost to the Buccaneers in the playoffs.
By win percentage, the Steelers have the hardest schedule in the NFL next season.
Of note, the Bears, Vikings and Detroit Lions all have harder schedules by win percentage.
Among the quarterbacks the Packers will face in 2021: Patrick Mahomes, Russell Wilson, Lamar Jackson, Matthew Stafford, Kirk Cousins, Kyler Murray, Ben Roethlisberger and Baker Mayfield.
Packers opponents (2020 record)
Home: Chicago Bears (8-8), Detroit Lions (5-11), Minnesota Vikings (7-9), Cleveland Browns (11-5), Los Angeles Rams (10-6), Pittsburgh Steelers (12-4), Seattle Seahawks (12-4), Washington Football Team (7-9)
Away: Chicago Bears (8-8), Detroit Lions (5-11), Minnesota Vikings (7-9), Arizona Cardinals (8-8), Baltimore Ravens (11-5), Cincinnati Bengals (4-11-1), Kansas City Chiefs (14-2), New Orleans Saints (12-4), San Francisco 49ers (6-10)

Green Bay Packers receiver Davante Adams gave back to the high school that helped launch his football career.
With help from Wisconsin-based sports apparel supplier Eastbay, Adams surprised the football team at his alma mater in Palo Alto, California with new Jordan brand uniforms, cleats and shoes.
Adams said sports help unite communities and give kids an "escape" and an "outlet," providing the basis for him helping out his high school.
"Having Davante come back and give back is something they're going to remember the rest of their lives," Palo Alto coach Nelson Gifford said.

Value isn’t there for Packers to keep DL Dean Lowry




Brandon Carwile 

March 31, 2021



The decision to extend defensive end Dean Lowry is still baffling. The Green Bay Packers believed Lowry could replace Mike Daniels, but his impact hasn’t been anywhere close. We are one month away from the NFL draft, and Lowry still hasn’t been cut even though he will count $6.3 million towards the cap in 2021. For that kind of money, the value just isn’t there to pay Lowry for what he does on defense.
When the Packers did their first wave of cuts at the beginning of the offseason, they parted ways with right tackle Rick Wagner and inside linebacker...

Mark Murphy passes on answering questions about Aaron Rodgers' contract




Zach Kruse 

March 31, 2021



Green Bay Packers team president Mark Murphy passed on an opportunity to provide clarification on the status of Aaron Rodgers' contract, an on-going mystery dominating the team's start to the new league year.
Murphy was asked about the contract several times on Tuesday but declined each time to offer any specifics, according to Rob Demovsky of ESPN.
Murphy said the Packers were able to "create room with others," noting the contract restructures completed with six other veteran players to clear cap space earlier this month.
No veteran contract provided a bigger opportunity to clear cap space than Rodgers' deal, but...
