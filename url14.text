The Bills are hosting RB/return specialist Tyler Ervin on a free agent visit. After Andre Roberts departed in free agency, Ervin could help fill his role. Ervin was productive for the Packers over the past season and a half.
— Field Yates (@FieldYates) March 26, 2021

The Buffalo Bills might be starting the process of stealing away one of the Green Bay Packers’ free agents.
According to Field Yates of ESPN, the Bills will host running back and returner Tyler Ervin on a free-agent visit.
Ervin, 27, was claimed off of waivers by the Packers in December of 2019 and has played 12 games with the team over the last two seasons. He’s an unrestricted free agent.
While with the Packers, Ervin carried 14 times for 77 yards, caught 13 passes for 95 yards and returned 16 punts for 126 yards and 16 kickoffs for 356 yards.
After sparking the team’s return game to life to end 2019, Matt LaFleur and the Packers expanded Ervin’s role and used him more on offense in 2020. He was on the field for 142 offensive snaps, both as a running back and receiver and also on fly motion plays. Injuries limited him to just eight games and could be one reason why the Packers eventually let him sign elsewhere.
If Ervin lands in Buffalo, the Packers would need to find a player capable of contributing on special teams in the return game and also in the gadget role on offense, an increasingly important one for LaFleur’s motion-heavy scheme.
It’s possible an explosive rookie receiver who can play in the slot and handle the jet motion looks could be an option for replacing Ervin in 2021.

March 26, 2021



Green Bay Packers receiver Davante Adams gave back to the high school that helped launch his football career.
With help from Wisconsin-based sports apparel supplier Eastbay, Adams surprised the football team at his alma mater in Palo Alto, California with new Jordan brand uniforms, cleats and shoes.
Adams said sports help unite communities and give kids an "escape" and an "outlet," providing the basis for him helping out his high school.
"Having Davante come back and give back is something they're going to remember the rest of their lives," Palo Alto coach Nelson Gifford said.

March 26, 2021



The addition of a 17th regular-season game in 2021 means the Green Bay Packers will play 10 games against 2020 playoff teams next season.
The AFC champion Kansas City Chiefs were added to the Packers' list of opponents as part of the NFL's expansion to 17 games. The Chiefs will join the Chicago Bears (twice), New Orleans Saints, Seattle Seahawks, Pittsburgh Steelers, Baltimore Ravens, Cleveland Browns, Los Angeles Rams and the Washington Football Team as playoff teams on the Packers' schedule in 2021.
Seven of the 10 teams finished above .500.

Value isn’t there for Packers to keep DL Dean Lowry




Brandon Carwile 

March 26, 2021



The decision to extend defensive end Dean Lowry is still baffling. The Green Bay Packers believed Lowry could replace Mike Daniels, but his impact hasn’t been anywhere close. We are one month away from the NFL draft, and Lowry still hasn’t been cut even though he will count $6.3 million towards the cap in 2021. For that kind of money, the value just isn’t there to pay Lowry for what he does on defense.
When the Packers did their first wave of cuts at the beginning of the offseason, they parted ways with right tackle Rick Wagner and inside linebacker...
