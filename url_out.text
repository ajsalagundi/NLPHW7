Robert from Salem, WI
Do you see an area that the team may focus on in the upcoming draft?
More than one, actually.
Rodney from Colleyville, TX
Can the Packers draft defense needed at the current low draft pick in round 1?
As far as the availability of big guys goes, it would appear late in the first round there could be more possibilities on the offensive line than the defensive line.
I'm not as concerned about options at other positions.
But nobody knows how it's gonna fall.
Vinny from Arlington, VA
Hi Mike, last offseason, a major topic involved top pending free agents with ﻿Kenny Clark﻿, ﻿David Bakhtiari﻿, Corey Linsley, ﻿Aaron Jones﻿, and ﻿Kevin King﻿ set to hit free agency this offseason.
Discussions centered on which players to prioritize; how many could conceivably be brought back; and how this could all be done with a projected reduction in the cap for the first time due to a drop in revenues due to the pandemic.
Now a year later, did you think then they'd be able to bring back four of the five?
I thought three was the max, but bringing back King on a one-year deal with much of the cap charge pushed into the future isn't the same commitment made to the other three.
Jim from Fairview Heights, IL
I guess I'm in the minority concerning the Packers and the signing of free agents.
I was looking at the list of players that are still out there and available.
There's still a lot of quality players out there and IMHO, the longer they're out there the farther down their price tag goes!
This seems to favor the patient GM rather than the jump-in-at-all-cost guy.
I'll take that patient guy any day!
Every team sets values on what they believe certain players are worth.
Then it's a matter of staying disciplined.
Scott from Las Vegas, NV
I often wonder how much intelligence plays into how good a QB is.
Granted, they need to be athletic, but I compare it to racquetball when you first learn, you're running all over the court and after you learn the angles you can place the ball and let your opponent run all over the place.
Don't you think that the intelligence factor plays a big role in a QB?
When a guy with the physical tools necessary to play quarterback at an elite level is also the smartest player on the field, it creates an edge that never dulls.
Bob from Cortez, CO
Has ﻿Aaron Rodgers﻿ had the opportunity to walk up to a player and tell them that he played against their dad?
He didn't have to.
Antoine Winfield Jr. was well aware last year.

Scott from Grovetown, GA
Greetings Mike.
You said it's better to stick with your known versus unknown.
If I may play devil's advocate and say sometimes you need to move on from that known player.
Please don't construe this as a strike against KK, but there are situations where a player that's known can't cut it and it's better to give the unknown a chance.
Like GB did a few years ago.
True enough, but again, it's about the size of the commitment and assignment of values.
When options are limited, one venture into the unknown can consume the entire budget.
Value discipline can bridge the gap until better options for improvement are available.
Jesse from Andover, MN
In response to your comment about us not preparing for the Niners, we got extremely lucky in that their entire team got hurt so we can't really surmise whether or not we would have been better than them.
On that topic would your response be the same in that we don't need to do anything to improve our team to beat TB?
Seeing as how they beat us 2/2 times last year.
I'll wait for your company response.
Ha, well, I'm glad you find my "company response" so contemptible you read it anyway.
But derision aside, you're missing the point, which is that no offseason can be geared toward beating a single opponent because you never know what's going to happen to that club, which was proven last year with the 49ers' injuries.
You make it sound like my approach is to not improve the team at all.
Of course you push to improve, but none of the Packers' moves this offseason should be geared specifically toward beating the Buccaneers.
That would be a fool's errand, as it would have been last year relative to the 49ers.
Mike from Hastings, MN
Mike, I think you're rushing back too fast from your two weeks off.
Shouldn't you take it easy for a while?
Nicely done, among many similar submissions, plus several "The Big Lebowski" references I honestly did not intend.
I think we've reached the point in the offseason where the Inbox is officially out of control.
Not that there's anything wrong with that.
Doug from Neenah, WI
Good morning, Mike.
The Seattle Football Team (SFT) traded away first- and third-round 2021 draft picks to acquire safety Jamal Adams from the Jets.
Plus a first in 2022.
As a result of this and other trades, SFT only has three picks left in this year's draft...second, fourth and seventh rounds.
Is this what "going all-in" looks like?
As I said yesterday, I'm not reopening that discussion.
But having only three picks, and just one in the top half of the draft (total draft capital of 384 points, by the way, the equivalent of one mid second-round pick), is not an ideal spot for a team that just got bounced in the wild-card round and hasn't reached an NFC title game since having to show its QB the money.
James from Asheville, NC
Tight end seems be among the deepest positions for the Packers.
We know what Big Bob can do stretching the field, ﻿Marcedes Lewis﻿ brings a veteran presence and great blocking skills, and even in his short sample I saw enough of ﻿Dominique Dafney﻿ to think he's a "real football player."
Because of injuries we've yet to see what the full potential of ﻿Josiah Deguara﻿ or ﻿Jace Sternberger﻿ might be.
Regarding Josiah and Jace, what specific skill sets do they offer that make management so high on them?
Sternberger has the kind of size, speed, and catch radius that makes him a matchup problem in the open field, and he showed in his limited playing time as a rookie the knocks on his blocking skills were exaggerated.
Deguara is the type who can line up anywhere – tight, wide, slot, backfield – and do whatever's asked, giving the offense a way to keep defenses guessing as to what he's up to, and have him execute different assignments from the same formation.
Health is paramount for both.
Spencer from Fulda, MN
Has ﻿Allen Lazard﻿ or ﻿Robert Tonyan﻿ signed their tenders yet?
Are we at risk of losing both or are they possibly looking at longer deals for those guys?
There's no risk of losing Lazard, whose tender is exclusive rights.
Tonyan has not signed his RFA tender yet, but there's been no news on him getting offers from elsewhere.
Daniel from Waukesha, WI
I would consider the following six CBs in the Favre-Rodgers era to be somewhere between very good and elite – Charles Woodson, Doug Evans, Sam Shields, Tramon Williams, Craig Newsome (loved Newsome!)
and Al Harris.
﻿Jaire Alexander﻿ has had a great start to his Packers career.
Will he eventually be in the same class as the others mentioned?
Yes, if he's not already.

Bob from Cortez, CO
With all the talk of how the Packers have to improve, how many plays had to go differently for a perfect season and a Super Bowl appearance?
A dozen, half dozen?
That's a dangerous road that's futile to go down.
Or maybe it's a futile road that's dangerous to go down.
Either way, stay away.
Rob from Edinburgh, Scotland
Yet another quick question regarding the 17th game.
If the conferences alternate who hosts, then the AFC West will host the NFC North again when it cycles around in four years' time.
Is the NFC going to host the 17th game back-to-back in 2024 and 2025 to compensate for this?
Great question.
You'd think an adjustment would have to be made at some point.
Chuck from Gold Canyon, AZ
Welcome back, Mike.
With 10 picks in the draft, there is a lot of opportunities for Gutey to move up (or down) and even look at acquiring additional draft capital in future years.
In looking at past Packers drafts where we have had several compensatory picks like this year, both Gutey and TT tend to triple up in area of need with DB, WR and OL all having been addressed in this manner.
With that in mind, what position group do you feel might be targeted for more swings at this year?
My best guess would be cornerback, but there's no telling how it shakes out.
Adam from Madison, WI
Thanks for triggering the 1992 draft memories.
That was the first draft I followed closely and was crushed when I heard the Packers traded a first for Favre.
Then crushed again when they didn't take Troy Vincent and then a final time when I saw they could have had Tommy Maddox with the pick they traded for Favre.
I was 1-for-3 I guess.
No one said this draft business was easy, right?
Matt from Chicago, IL
Last year, the offense being in the second year of a system sounded like a crucial ingredient to the team's success.
Similarly I believe that contributed to the defense's success and improvement in 2019-2020.
Wouldn't it be fair to have lower expectations for the 2021 Packers given the defensive schematic changes?
I don't think that's how Matt LaFleur sees it.
There will naturally be some growing pains, but my impression is he doesn't believe the scheme change is dramatic enough to require a major transition and therefore any lower expectations.
That's not how LaFleur operates.

When will the complete schedule, practices, preseason games, etc., be available?
The full NFL schedule will be released sometime in May.
The Packers usually announce their training camp schedule in June.
Steven from Silver Spring, MD
Does it seem unusual to have all of our WRs entering the last year of their contracts?
Maybe the players themselves are the ones not interested in extensions if they feel the next year will have a larger bank of dollars for teams to draw from?
I don't think that's it.
Cap charges can always be manipulated.
Each case is different.
With ﻿Davante Adams﻿, I don't think the Packers will let him get anywhere close to free agency, but an absolute top-of-the-market deal or extension – which is what he's in line for – can take a long time to figure out.
With ﻿Marquez Valdes-Scantling﻿, I'm sure he'd like to move past the drops and put up bigger numbers to see what he can get.
Lazard has nothing to negotiate until he accrues his third season.
Douglas from Bloomington, IL
With the Packers needing to make cap room for 10 draft picks, do you think they might trade some of their picks to move up and thus have fewer players they have to make cap room for?
Or are the rookie contracts so small that it's inconsequential?
They only need room for the draft-pick contracts that fall within the top 51 during the offseason, which won't be all of them.
Come roster cut-down time, they'll only need room for the contracts of the guys who make the team.
Dale from Prescott, WI
Mike, you able to make the Brewers' home opener Thursday?
I'll be checking the score while working, with a Brewer shirt on, so I've got that going for me, which is nice.
I had to let Wes get a few more vacation days in this week, so I plan on writing Friday morning's column with one eye on the game Thursday afternoon.
Scott from Sauk City, WI
Speaking of Opening Day, how do you feel about the 2021 Brewers?
I love the Kolten Wong signing, but our SP depth makes me nervous.
That group is one injury away from big trouble, IMO.
Most "experts" have us top three in the Central, which seems about right to me.
The Nolan Arenado trade made the Cardinals the prohibitive favorite in the division.
The Brewers' prospects depend, as you said, on the starting pitching and a few regulars finding their hitting stroke again after a rough 2020.
Jeff from Eveleth, MN
Someone asked you if a person's legacy can be determined by a single event?
The closest example I could think of was Scott Norwood.
"Wide Right."
I still can't imagine how that must have felt.
On the flip side, there's Mike Eruzione.
Happy Wednesday.
HAVE A QUESTION?
It takes a village of scouts to draft a player
No one really knows what's going to happen until it happens
The complexion of an NFL schedule often looks vastly different come December
There's plenty of value in chemistry and continuity
It has to be a first, or very rare
It just means the game is the game
There's no reason to prioritize one position
Explosiveness and vision are what make Aaron Jones special
It's not easy making the cut
The D-Train isn't just a slogan.
The camaraderie is real.
Who are the best defensive players drafted over the last 30 years?

Let's pretend you are the GM for a second.
On draft day when you are up to make your first pick you see that there is a player for every single position with the exact same draft grade.
What position do you choose with your first pick and why?
Assuming I don't need a quarterback, I'm taking a big guy.
Offensive or defensive lineman.

I'm all for more submissions that test his patience.
I'm sure he is not, though.
Ha.
Wes is back tomorrow, and then our more normal rotation will resume (I think).
Dan from Kenosha, WI
Mike, is it wrong for me to fantasize about the Packers making a move on draft day to lock up a corner like Greg Newsome Jr.?
The thought of someone like him playing opposite of ﻿Jaire Alexander﻿ has me dreaming of defensive dominance … the pass rush gets better … run reads get easier … everything is easier when you make one phase of the game harder.
I don't think the Packers are one corner away from "defensive dominance," but Newsome sure appears to be a potential need/value fit at the bottom of the first round from what I'm hearing.
Robert from Verona, WI
Looking at the Packers' roster, which player(s) do you think will start garnering national recognition this season?
It feels like ﻿Rashan Gary﻿ is the most likely candidate, but I could see ﻿AJ Dillon﻿ making waves as well.
Those are two worthwhile choices.
I'd throw in ﻿Darnell Savage﻿ as well.
Jeff from Littlefork, MN
I've seen the II asked recently if players read the Inbox.
﻿Adrian Amos﻿ just tweeted, in part, "ain't no lasers on the field..." I guess we know one stud safety that does NOT read the Inbox.
I used to like him so much, too.
I don't blame Adrian one bit for steering clear of here.

Hi II, longtime reader since the Vic days.
Drew Brees had an amazing career and deserves all the plaudits he is receiving.
AR12 has arguably a more impressive resume, yet his achievements seem to be overlooked in comparison.
Both have been unlucky in NFCC games, and either could have arguably been to more Super Bowls.
I'm interested in your take on why they seem to be viewed via a different lens.
This is a common question, and a reasonable one.
I've said before I think it has mostly to do with the circumstances of the two franchises and their histories.
Brees brought the Saints up from nothing, especially after Katrina.
That team was in the doldrums for a long time, with one playoff win since their founding until Brees arrived.
﻿Aaron Rodgers﻿ took command of a perennial playoff contender and one of the most storied franchises in league history.
Fair or unfair, those contexts have influenced perceptions.
Matthew from Teaneck, NJ
So we're at 17 games in an 18-week season.
Any thoughts as to having the bye week be dead center in the season?
That would be fair and consistent for all, right?
The TV networks would not have upped the ante as considerably as they did if a dark weekend were part of the deal.
Mike from Fort Wayne, IN
Mike, now that there is a 17th game, how long do you think it will be before the owners become bored and start clamoring for an 18th game?
Or is 17 just about the apex?
I'm sure the owners will push for 18 games in the next CBA negotiations at the end of the decade, unless there are more pressing issues for the league to address.
Patrick from Valrico, FL
Looks like the Chiefs are trying to add more fuel to an old II fire with their rules proposal.
Of all of these proposals which do you feel are the most and least likely to pass?
I vowed never to discuss jersey numbers again.
I just can't do it.
Scott from New Orleans, LA
Roster turnover is a constant in the NFL, but this year we have seemed to maintain the majority of our main contributors, which leads to continued chemistry on the field and in the locker room.
What is your opinion on how the Packers have approached the offseason so far?
There's plenty of value in chemistry and continuity when you've been as successful as the Packers have the past two years, but I think the salary-cap constraints for this year and next have limited Gutekunst's offseason options.
I do believe we'd have witnessed more turnover under normal circumstances.
We'll see what the draft at the end of the month brings, but the majority of this team's improvement will have to come from within – particularly players from the last two draft classes making significant strides.
Patrick from Murfreesboro, TN
Cornerback seems to be headlining the "needs attention" discussions, and I understand the concern.
But isn't D-line perilously vulnerable after ﻿Kenny Clark﻿?
What's the outlook on the type of DL profile that would best fit a Barry defense?
I'm not sure if there's a particular profile.
Another Kenny Clark would do just fine.
As I've mentioned before, I'm just not sure if one will be there late in the first round.
In the middle rounds it becomes even more hit-and-miss with those big guys.
You can find a solid performer like ﻿Dean Lowry﻿ (fourth round, 2016), or it might not work out as hoped with a Montravius Adams (third round, 2017).
In that vein, here's a key player in the improvement-from-within equation: ﻿Kingsley Keke﻿ (fifth round, 2019).
Derek from Sheboygan, WI
What are the chances the Packers take an offensive lineman or tackle with the 29th pick of the draft?
Based on what I'm gleaning about this draft, the chances appear better for an offensive lineman at the bottom of the first round than a defensive one.
Take a look at photos of Green Bay Packers DL Kingsley Keke from the 2020 season.

Nik from Moore, SC
Which "Wisconsin athlete" has the best chance of winning the next MVP … Giannis, ARod, Yeli, or someone else?
I wouldn't bet against any of the three you mentioned.
Arthur from Eau Claire, WI
In your opinion, which NFC North team has had the best offseason so far (pre-draft)?
It's a tough call between the Packers and Vikings.
Re-signing ﻿Aaron Jones﻿ I think is the biggest move anyone in the division has made, but losing Corey Linsley is significant, too.
Minnesota's signings of Dalvin Tomlinson, Patrick Peterson and Mackensie Alexander will certainly help Mike Zimmer get his defense back to its more accustomed place in the league rankings.
Sawyer from Simpsonville, SC
Mike, reading the Packers' release on the schedule change and remembering that there is now a bye week between the end of the preseason and the regular season just clicked; do you think we'll see starters play more in Week 3, knowing they have a whole bye, or will they play less knowing you have one less game to evaluate guys in?
I suspect it'll be the latter.
I think we'll soon reach a point where veteran starters won't be taking any preseason snaps at all.
Rick from Milwaukee, WI
If NFL teams play a regular-season game in Canada is it on an 80-yard field?
Oh boy.
Greg from Perkasie, PA
I was watching Aaron Jones highlights from last year (because offseason) and right after his receiving touchdown against the Falcons I saw Big Bob Tonyan counting the defenders around him (4) that left Aaron Jones wide open.
I remember ﻿Davante Adams﻿ also counting defenders around him in a game against the Bears.
I laughed both times, but I also think it showcases just how many weapons the Packers actually have.
Fans also don't like to hear "miscommunication" as the reason for a bad play on defense, but it does happen.
Mike from Ames, IA
With the 17th game added, do you see coaches becoming more conservative with injured players?
The NFL is still the only of the four major sport leagues where it's uncommon for players to get games off to rest, but the added risk of injury has to be considered against the need to have your best players on any given Sunday.
I think most teams will make their active/inactive game-day decisions similarly.
If anything, more conservatism could creep into how coaches handle players' practice regimens.
Steven from Silver Spring, MD
I think it is important to point out in the strength of schedule debate the idea that every year the strong teams change.
We had this same discussion last year and sure enough look how our daunting trip out to SF on a Thursday night turned out in '20.
Of all those playoff teams posted on the schedule it is a reasonable argument that over half won't be the challenge we anticipated in the offseason.
Likely true.

Kevin from Starr Pass, AZ
Mike, welcome back as you wrap up your first week back.
Your answer to Thomas from Cedar Rapids, IA, yesterday got me wondering what a draft board looks like.
It sounds like it's much more complicated than a 1-N list of best to worst players.
This is a vast oversimplication, and I've never actually seen the Packers' draft board long enough to study it.
But in a basic sense, think of a horizontal and vertical grid, with one axis representing positions, the other the various grades/evaluations/round projections, and player names arranged accordingly in the matrix.
Then names get removed when players are picked.
So as the draft progresses, the board can have depth horizontally or vertically at given moments depending on when/where there are clusters of players at the same positions or with similar grades.
When the grades are bunched, it can be a signal to trade back if possible.
Conversely, if it's looking like the board will be thin by the time your pick arrives, a trade up might be the way to maximize value.
Hope that admittedly rudimentary description helps.
Dale from Lima, NY
If the last pick in the seventh round of the draft (No.
259 this year, I believe) is nicknamed "Mr.
Irrelevant," then what should we call all the UDFA players who make it onto a team's active roster?
Profiles in perseverance.
Bobby from St. Petersburg, FL
If you're doing London you have to be having an Old Speckled Hen or on a stretch a Wexford's Cream Ale (I know, Wex' is Irish but so is Guinness).
You'll love it!
London is my favorite city internationally speaking.
Always "look right first" and "mind the gap"!
Duly noted on all counts.
Ben from Spokane, WA
Can anyone stop the Zags?
My money is on no.
I think Baylor can give them a game.
I'd like to see Gonzaga against that defense.
Any other matchup in the final would disappoint me, frankly.
Ron from Waukesha, WI
Spoff: After decades of following the NFL Draft this is what I know to be true.
Higher picks are better than lower picks.
More picks are better than less picks.
And when it's all said and done you're usually more wrong than right.
Is there anything you'd like to add?
Nope.
You've pretty much covered it.
Levi from St. Paul, MN
The modern NFL is a year-to-year league now more than ever.
I've decided to stop paying attention to AR contract talk and 2022 salary cap issues and look at the possibility of 2021 being another big year for GB and let the chips fall where they may.
Look what they did this year to keep the team together.
I have trust that they will draft well and "cut the fat" so to say with bad contracts to stay competitive.
So Packer fans r-e-l-a-x and enjoy the process.
Worry gets you nowhere.
I don't quite follow the concluding Marvel universe reference, so I'll let Wes sort it out.
Ryan from Noblesville, IN
I have no question so I leave it up to you Mike to enlighten us with something nobody is asking about.
One down (or, gratefully, up), 161 to go.
Happy (Good) Friday.
HAVE A QUESTION?
It takes a village of scouts to draft a player
No one really knows what's going to happen until it happens
The complexion of an NFL schedule often looks vastly different come December
It has to be a first, or very rare
There's no telling how it shakes out
It just means the game is the game
There's no reason to prioritize one position
Explosiveness and vision are what make Aaron Jones special
It's not easy making the cut
The D-Train isn't just a slogan.
The camaraderie is real.
Who are the best defensive players drafted over the last 30 years?

USA Football, the sport's national governing body and a member of the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC), today introduced its Athlete Health & Wellness Recommendations for youth football play that have earned endorsements by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), the National Athletic Trainers' Association (NATA) and the National Youth Sports Health & Safety Institute (NYSHSI).
Packers President/CEO Mark Murphy is a member of USA Football's board of directors.
The eight recommendations advance smarter play through new training and practice standards, use of the two-point stance and days of rest between full contact games and scrimmages.
USA Football's recommendations were developed in collaboration with its Task Force on Athlete Health and Wellness, a subgroup of its FDM Council.
The recommendations are aligned with USA Football's Football Development Model (FDM), designed to develop the whole athlete based on a child's age and stage of development in alignment with the USOPC's American Development Model.
The Task Force on Athlete Health and Wellness is comprised of leaders across football, sport science, medicine and long-term athlete development.
"As is evidenced by the support of several leading sports medicine and health care organizations, our Task Force members helped develop world-class athlete health and wellness recommendations for youth football," said U.S. Tennis Association University Managing Director and USA Football Task Force on Athlete Health and Wellness Chair Dr. Paul Roetert.
"These recommendations provide the basis for the implementation of new standards focused on young players of all ages, and as importantly, all stages of development."
Combined, the ACSM, NATA and NYSHSI represent more than 50,000 members and certified professionals worldwide, representing 70 occupations across sports medicine and health care.
USA Football's recommendations for youth football and accompanying rationale are accessible here.
A summary of the recommendations are below.
"USA Football's recommendations for youth play, created in conjunction with credentialed leaders of diverse expertise, hold myriad near- and long-term benefits for young athletes," ACSM President Dr. Nicole Keith said.
"Taking one of our most popular physical activities for children – youth football – and boldly reimagining it in this way is leadership one would expect from a national governing body of sport.
The ACSM is proud to endorse these recommendations."
"It is critical that the health and safety of athletes is always the number one priority," said NATA President Tory Lindley, MA, ATC.
"The National Athletic Trainers' Association endorses USA Football's new 'Athlete Health and Wellness Recommendations' and applauds USA Football for its continued commitment to a smarter and safer approach to sport."
"Applying the best available science to seasoned insight and relevant, real-world experiences across medicine and sporting activities like football is exciting and uncommon – this is what USA Football has done," said NYSHSI Leadership Board Member Dr. Thayne Munce.
"This is what I would want my child's youth league to teach, practice and play.
And children in such leagues will have more fun, likely experience greater skill development and be more inclined to live healthy, active lifestyles as adults."
USA Football's Athlete Health & Wellness Recommendations, endorsed by the ACSM, NATA and NYSHSI:
1.
Guidelines for sport-specific football training by age-band
In alignment with the philosophy of the Football Development Model, this recommendation provides a clear and gradual progression relative to both the frequency and duration of practices as a young athlete grows and develops.
The following table is within the recommendations based on current research regarding athlete workload, including those established by NATA (Youth Sport Specialization Safety Recommendations; Prevention of Pediatric Overuse Injuries).
Note: This recommendation is strictly concerned with the frequency and duration of practices as it relates to age.
Time limits on contact are addressed within other recommendations.
2.
Recommendation to prohibit select drills
In the interest of safer play and to remove high-risk drills which have limited transfer to skill development, USA Football recommends youth programs prohibit contact drills that meet the following criteria:
This would include player-to-player contact drills such as:
3.
Recommendation on the Two-Point Stance
For youth football programs playing any version of Non-Contact, Limited Contact and/or Modified Contact games (i.e., Rookie Tackle®), it is recommended that all players initiate movement from the two-point stance.
4.
Recommendation at the youth Senior Tackle™ level (traditional full field, full contact) to use the two-point stance for offensive players
For youth tackle football played at the Senior Tackle™ level (traditional full field, full contact), programs are encouraged to instruct and use the two-point stance for players on the offensive side of the line of scrimmage.
5.
Recommendation to limit full contact activities on consecutive days
USA Football recommends that practices involving drills or activities considered to be full contact are not allowed on consecutive days.
This includes the day following a game or live-action scrimmage.
Full contact is defined as any drill or activity in which contact occurs at a competitive speed.
Full contact drills and activities are based on the initial player-to-player contact, regardless of whether an athlete goes to ground or not.
View USA Football's Levels of Contact here.
6.
Recommendation for Maximum Games Per Week (Contact)
No more than one full contact game or live-action scrimmage is recommended per week.
In postseason, a minimum of three days should lapse between full contact games.
7.
Recommendation for preseason practice contact guidelines
Following the acclimatization period, during the preseason (prior to regular season play), it is recommended that coaches limit the amount of full contact to no more than 75 minutes per week with no more than 30 minutes on any one day.
Full contact is defined as any drill or activity in which contact occurs at a competitive speed.
Full contact drills and activities are based on the initial player-to-player contact, regardless of whether an athlete goes to ground or not.
View USA Football's youth practice guidelines here.
8.
Recommendation for regular season practice contact guidelines
Following the preseason period, once regular season competitions begin, it is recommended that coaches limit the amount of full contact to no more than 60 minutes per week with no more than 30 minutes on any one day.
Full contact is defined as any drill or activity in which contact occurs at a competitive speed.
Full contact drills and activities are based on the initial player-to-player contact, regardless of whether the player goes to the ground or not.

GREEN BAY – A year ago, there's no way ﻿Allen Lazard﻿ could have brought himself to do it.
Even now, it isn't exactly comfortable for the Packers' second-year receiver to speak up in a meeting room with a future Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback and 13 other offensive players with more accrued seasons on their NFL resume.
However, Lazard saw something on film recently regarding the skill-position players' blocking that wasn't quite right.
As someone who considers himself "the best blocking wideout in the league," Lazard felt compelled to use his voice.
"It just seemed like a necessity," Lazard said.
"I think it was something that we needed to address as an offense, especially as a wide receiver group.
"It was more so just making sure we're all working together and have the same technique in mind so we're able to capitalize on those RPOs (run-pass options) that we run."
That's the difference in Allen Lazard, Year 2.
As a first-year player in 2019, the 6-foot-5, 227-pound receiver went from the practice squad to the Packers' No.
2 receiver over the course of three months.
He kept his head down, worked to gain ﻿Aaron Rodgers﻿' trust and prove he belonged at this level.
In 2020, Lazard has tried to step more out of his comfort zone and show who is, as a player and as a person.
He's grown out his hair, adding a shock of blond hair near his hairline.
Lazard does a "Juice of the day" video on his Instagram page.
It's meant to promote wellness but also overtly points to Lazard's desire to maintain his energy level and drive.
"I think this year I've kind of grown into who I am and my identity and everything," Lazard said.
"Last year was a big year just getting experience, really playing for the first time.
It was a lot different than being on the practice squad and my role changed a lot throughout last year, and this year, as well, too.
I feel like the past two years, I've just been growing every single day, personally, on and off the field."
That's where the "crown" comes into play.
While out of action earlier this season following core-muscle surgery, Lazard was following along with some of the national storylines about the game's best receivers.
﻿Davante Adams﻿ wasn't mentioned.
What started with the "Top two, not two" social media campaign among Adams' teammates led to Lazard busting out a new touchdown celebration after he returned from injured reserve – symbolically crowning Adams after a TD.
It's since spread to the rest of the Packers' skill-position players.
"I've told him many times he's one of my favorite teammates that I've had since I've been here, and that says a lot because there's been a lot of great players and great men," Adams said.
"Everything about him since he's been here has been positive and it's been great for us as a team.
I often remind him to remain who you are and keep doing the little things you do to help this football team win, and we're going to end up where we want to be."
Lazard isn't just a hype man.
He's very much been a part of the Packers' success this year.
His injury, which came at the tail end of a 146-yard performance against New Orleans in Week 3, left an irreplaceable void in the offense for the next six games.
The structure of Head Coach Matt LaFleur's offense is night-and-day compared to the system Lazard played in under Matt Campbell during his final year at Iowa State, but he's still thrived in both.
The 25-year-old receiver's role in Green Bay's offense is multifaceted.
He caught a definitive 58-yard TD in the Packers' playoff win over the Los Angeles Rams, but Lazard also can be utilized as an H-back lending a hand in the run game.
To his credit, he embraces all of it.
"Allen's an undrafted guy who had to work his tail off to even just get a shot to get someone to look his way," said tight end ﻿Robert Tonyan﻿, another former undrafted free agent who's since developed into a key contributor in the Packers' offense.
"Allen's always been a big personality, a great vibe on the team, a great teammate.
He wants others to succeed as much as he wants to succeed.
So it's nothing new for guys in the building for the past couple of years that we've known Allen.
It's him getting his chance to go out there and make plays and be that personality."
This weekend, Green Bay hosts Tampa Bay in the NFC Championship.
For Lazard, it'll be his first shot at the Buccaneers after having to sit out of the Packers' 38-10 loss in Tampa back in Week 6.
Emotions are high this week but so is the energy.
It brings Lazard back to a conversation he had with Rodgers almost two years ago now when he commended Lazard for how well he'd been performing on the scout team.
It was a pivotal moment in the young receiver's career that made him feel unstoppable.
Having earned Rodgers' trust and friendship, Lazard now hopes to place the greatest crown of all atop the head of his two-time MVP quarterback.
"It means everything to me right now, to be in this position that I've been in," Lazard said.
"Just to be able to have him say those words to me, and then those words coming to fruition for me to lead the threes and fours to work my way up to the ones and twos.
"I'm in the huddle with him.
I'm starting games and he's counting on me in certain situations.
At this point, it's nothing new as far as going out there and having high expectations for myself to be able to produce, and for the team to be able to lean on me more than it used to."

Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers might not be satisfied with just a two-week guest-hosting experience on “Jeopardy!” In fact, the three-time MVP is legitimately interested in becoming the full-time host and successor to Alex Trebek, who hosted the show for 37 seasons.
Rodgers told “The Pat McAfee Show” on Monday that he would “love to be the host” of the iconic game show.
And he wasn’t just kidding around.
Rodgers is working under the assumption that he could continue to be an NFL quarterback while hosting the show.
Here’s what Rodgers said to Claire McNear of The Ringer: “I don’t think I’d need to give up football to do it.
They film 46 days a year.
I worked 187 this year in Green Bay.
That gives me, eh—[pauses]—178 days to do Jeopardy!
So I feel like I could fit 46 into that 178 and make it work.
It would be a dream job for sure, and I’m not shy at all about saying I want the job.
That’s how I went into it.
I want an opportunity to be in the mix.”
Rodgers, who turns 38 in December, is one of several guest hosts picked by the show to keep the games going after Trebek’s passing last November.
His 10-episode run started Monday and lasts two weeks.
Rodgers told Rob Demovsky of ESPN that studied for “hours and hours” and took “pages and pages” of notes in preparation for the hosting gig.
He both wanted to honor Trebek’s legacy and impress the decision-makers at “Jeopardy!” during the filming, which was completed in February.
A long-time fan of the show, winner of “Celebrity Jeopardy!” in 2015 and lover of trivia, Rodgers has called being the host a “dream job.”
The California native has been the Packers quarterback since 2005, and he’s under contract in Green Bay for three more seasons.
Here’s why Rodgers thinks he’d be a good pick to replace Trebek as the full-time host, per McNeal: “I respect the show and appreciate the history of it, and also there’s my background of stepping in for a legend and their footsteps.
I feel like all that combined makes me a pretty good candidate.”
Super Bowl-winning quarterback and game-show host?
Rodgers might make it possible soon.

Free agent offensive lineman Lane Taylor visited his second team since the start of the new league year.
According to the league's transaction wire, Taylor – a starter for the Green Bay Packers to open the 2020 season – visited the Houston Texans on Monday.
Taylor visited the San Francisco 49ers last month.
Both teams likely want to check in on his recovery from the ACL injury he suffered in Week 1 of last year.
Taylor took a pay cut and returned to the Packers in 2020, and a strong summer earned him the starting job at right guard.
He was lost...
Daniel Jeremiah's latest mock draft for NFL.com has the Green Bay Packers getting help for the interior of the offensive line in the first round.
Jeremiah sent Alabama offensive lineman Landon Dickerson to the Packers at No.

I thought he might fall out of the first round after his ACL injury, but it appears his recovery is going smoothly.
He can step in following the departure of Corey Linsley."

The first episode of Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers hosting "Jeopardy!"
aired Monday.
The three-time MVP has nine more episodes airing over the next two weeks.
How did Rodgers do during his opening appearance?
It's time to go to the tape to evaluate the performance.
Here's a light-hearted breakdown of Rodgers' first episode as guest host (note: spoilers ahead):
– Solid intro.
Looks confident, ready for the moment.
Possibly too much swaying back and forth.
He might be fighting some nerves, and that's just fine.
– Terrific job reading the opening categories.

GREEN BAY – ﻿Aaron Rodgers﻿ got everything he wanted out of this 2020 season, except a win on Sunday.
"I'm just pretty gutted," Rodgers said after a devastating 31-26 loss to the Buccaneers in his first NFC title game at Lambeau Field.
"We had a lot of chances.
Overall, just pretty gutted."
Rodgers' emotions were very real and very raw, yet as he always does, he articulated them quite well.
He talked about his appreciation for his teammates, and how the Packers gave themselves the best opportunity they could ask for, earning the only playoff bye in the NFC and getting to play at home in January.
But none of it was enough, and for a while the presumptive league MVP will be thinking about three straight possessions in the fourth quarter of a one-score game that couldn't produce the touchdown the Packers so desperately needed.
"It's a grind just to get to this point," he said.
"It makes the finality of it all kind of hit you like a ton of bricks.
That's why it's a gutting feeling in your stomach."
The loss is Rodgers' fourth straight in an NFC Championship, making him 1-4 after winning his first one 10 years ago.
The defeats have taken on all shapes and sizes now, from the collapse at Seattle, to two blowouts on the road, to Sunday's game full of regrets in front of a pandemic-limited home crowd.
Asked whether a loss like this will potentially haunt him the rest of his career as he continues to seek a second Super Bowl, Rodgers didn't go that far.
But he didn't downplay it, either.
"I don't know about haunted.
That word doesn't really fit in my vocabulary I think," he said.
"This one definitely stings and is going to for a long time, especially the way it played out and the chances we had and the opportunities we had to seize that game at various points.
"This definitely hurts, but I don't believe in games haunting me.
It won't haunt me, it's just going to hurt for a while."
He acknowledged, as he does every time a season ends, how there's so much uncertainty ahead with players needing new contracts, and not knowing what the locker room will look like later in 2021.
The only constant in the NFL is change.
He noted there's some uncertainty about his own future, with the Packers having spent a first-round draft pick on his possible successor last spring.
But Head Coach Matt LaFleur is of no mind to move on and made it very clear he wants Rodgers as his QB again next season.
"I sure as hell hope so," LaFleur said.
"I mean, the guy's the MVP of this league.
He's the heart and soul of our football team.
So, hell yeah, he better be back here.
"He's our leader.
His voice carries a lot of weight in that locker room and just, I feel for him.
Him being in this situation and for us not to get it done, man it hurts."
The pain came through in several of LaFleur's comments as he rehashed many of his own decisions throughout the game.
He lamented lacking a commitment to the running game on two goal-to-go series that ended in field goals, and on the two fourth-quarter three-and-outs following interceptions by Green Bay's defense.
"I put that on myself, just not calling the right plays," he said.
"The stuff we did so well all season long, we kind of got away from it, in the second half, especially that fourth quarter.
We just got out of our offense, and that's on me."
Lambeau Field hosted the NFC Championship Game between the Green Bay Packers and Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday, Jan. 24, 2021.
He'll likely wonder about not going for it on fourth-and-goal from the 8-yard line down eight points, and counting on his defense to stop Tom Brady again after it had allowed him just three points over a span of four possessions.
It was a lot to ask, given the effort already expended to make the comeback from an 18-point deficit possible.
"I felt like we had plenty of opportunities tonight to take advantage of and get the job done," LaFleur said.
"We didn't do it, and that falls on me.
"That's a tough pill to swallow when you're responsible for everybody in this organization to make sure that you're on your A-game, and I don't feel like I was tonight.
I'm just pretty disappointed that I let a lot of people down."
LaFleur's first two seasons in Green Bay have been loaded with success, and his offense and guidance got Rodgers back to MVP form.
None of that can be overlooked.
But the Packers were planning on playing one more game this season.
They had everything lined up just the way they wanted and needed, yet it still didn't work out.
It's all difficult, but perhaps nothing moreso than "the abruptness," as Rodgers put it.
"It's definitely sudden."

GREEN BAY – The Packers almost threw the knockout punch with ﻿Allen Lazard﻿ in the third quarter.
Then he got another chance.
Lazard's 58-yard touchdown catch off a play-action fake in the fourth quarter right down the middle of Lambeau Field helped seal Green Bay's 32-18 NFC Divisional playoff victory over the LA Rams on Saturday.
The big play restored the Packers' two-score lead to send them back to another NFC title game, this one at home next Sunday against either the Buccaneers or Saints.
"When the play was called, I was thinking touchdown for sure," said quarterback ﻿Aaron Rodgers﻿ of the play-action on second down, with the Packers' defense having just gotten a stop to preserve a 25-18 lead.
"Really tried to sell it, came up off the fake and saw Allen digging.
He made a really nice catch, kept his feet and put that thing away."
He had failed to do that two possessions earlier, when on a similar play, bending his route to the outside instead, Rodgers' throw – and a potential 60-yard TD, or a big gain at a minimum – went off his fingertips.
Leading 25-10 at that stage after Aaron Jones' 60-yard run to open the second half set up a touchdown, Green Bay didn't get the commanding three-score advantage it wanted, and never did.
But Lazard, who finished with four catches for 96 yards, certainly redeemed himself.
"Dropping that first one obviously hurt, especially at that time in the game," Lazard said.
"It was an unacceptable drop, but thankfully, my coaches, my teammates really trusted me.
Aaron threw a good ball for me to go make a play."
Added Head Coach Matt LaFleur: "Big-time play in a big moment."
The touchdown capped an impressive effort by the Packers and their top-ranked scoring offense against the Rams and their top-ranked scoring defense.
The Packers scored the first five times they touched the ball (three TDs, two FGs), then stalled twice before the clinching TD put Green Bay almost right on its regular-season scoring average of 31.8, far ahead of the Rams' average of 18.5 points allowed.
Asked who can stop Green Bay if the league's best defense can't, receiver Davante Adams simply said, "Nobody."
Adams got the Packers' first TD of the night, beating corner Jalen Ramsey on a double-motion from the 1-yard line, on his way to nine catches for 66 yards.
Green Bay's offensive line controlled the trenches, paving the way to 191 rushing yards before kneel-downs and no sacks of Rodgers (23-of-36, 296 yards, two TDs, 108.1 rating).
Rams stalwart Aaron Donald and his ailing ribs were rendered a non-factor by guard Elgton Jenkins and others, while the unit as a whole has once again adjusted without All-Pro left tackle David Bakhtiari﻿.
"Stellar is a good word," Rodgers said when asked to describe the line's play.
"Because it's rooted in star, and they were the stars of the game tonight.
That was a fantastic performance by them.
They dominated the line of scrimmage."
Jones finished with 99 rushing yards and a TD on 14 carries, Jamaal Williams added 65 yards on 12 attempts, and rookie AJ Dillon contributed 27 yards on six rushes, his last being a fumble that Rodgers fortunately recovered.
Lambeau Field hosted an NFC Divisional playoff matchup between the Green Bay Packers and Los Angeles Rams on Saturday, Jan. 16, 2021.
But the offense never turned it over, and the defense didn't get any takeaways either but did get some key stops down the stretch.
The Rams were feast or famine on offense through three quarters, going three-and-out three times but scoring on their other three drives (two TDs, one FG).
They got the ball once in the second half down by just one score, after Rams running back Cam Akers (18 carries, 90 yards) ran in a 7-yard TD out of the wildcat.
But defensive lineman ﻿Kenny Clark﻿'s second-down sack thwarted the Rams' next drive.
Then, after the two-score lead was re-established, a tackle for loss by cornerback ﻿Jaire Alexander﻿ followed by a ﻿Rashan Gary﻿ sack of Jared Goff on fourth down ended any LA comeback hopes.
"They were relentless all game," LaFleur said of the Packers' pass rush, which sacked an otherwise efficient Goff (21-of-27, 174 yards, one TD, 105.9 rating) four times.
"Our guys stayed resilient up front and kept giving great energy, great effort.
"And that's what it's going to take."
By game's end, Green Bay had nearly doubled the Rams' yardage total (484-244), been far more proficient on third down (8-of-12 vs. 2-for-8) and held a 12½-minute time of possession advantage (36:12 to 23:48).
The Packers would love nothing more than to bottle that formula and bring it back to Lambeau Field – which hosted an official paid attendance (7,439) for the first time this season – in a week.
"We'll enjoy it tonight," LaFleur said, "but we know we're going to have a really tough opponent coming into our place for the NFC Championship Game."

Hi everybody.
Thanks for logging on today.
We can get right to it.
Hi Mike, I read on another media outlet that this was the 18th time that ﻿Aaron Rodgers﻿ has been named NFC offensive player of the week.
How spoiled are we, that's an outlandish number isn't it?
Yeah, that's pretty crazy.
It's his 13th year as a starter, and he's missed a total of about one full season due to injuries.
To average more than one per year over such a long period of time is impressive, to say the least.
Special teams, an issue with players or coaching?
If its players, is it time to turn over a couple spots at the bottom of the roster or turn to starters?
If coaching, what's the end game because it's hard to believe that ML will continue to tolerate this.
I'd be guessing if I were to tell you where more of the blame lies.
But it doesn't really matter.
Things have to improve, and the current players and coaches have proven they can do better, so they should.
The breakdowns have to stop.
This week's referee is supposed to be Alex Kemp.
Isn't he known for calling a lot of penalties (see: Vikings at Packers, week 8)?
That sounds vaguely familiar.
I would expect both teams to be on their guard if Kemp's numbers have stayed high, though this year has been different with mixed crews on a weekly basis due to COVID, so it's not like a normal year in terms of predicting or planning for that.
Hey Mike- thanks for taking the time to do this.
How much of the offensive success do you think is due to LaFleur's scheme and how much do you think is due to Rodgers' adjustments at the line of scrimmage?
It's plenty of both.
The scheme gets guys open, and Rodgers goes through his progressions in rhythm.
If he sees a bad look at the line, he'll change it and it's usually a good call.
It's been a productive partnership obviously.
They trust one another and often know what each other is thinking.
Is this a new injury with ﻿Tyler Ervin﻿ or an old one continuing to dog him?
New things seem to keep popping up with Swerve on the injury list.
He's had a rough year in that regard.
Seems likely we'll see ﻿Tavon Austin﻿'s GB debut on Sunday.
Mike, the only time I ever even consider pulling for the Vikings is either when they're playing the Seahawks or this time of year when playoff positioning comes into play.
So, Vikings or Bucs?
I'll be writing about this in Path to the Playoffs, but it's definitely better for the Packers if the Vikings lose.
The only way the head-to-head loss to the Bucs will factor into the playoff seeding, assuming the Packers win the division (which they will with two more wins, or one win and a Vikings loss), is for the Bucs to win the South, and they're three games back of New Orleans with four to play, same separation as in the North.
Hey Mike, how serious of considerations do you think OC N. Hackett is getting for HC?
He's certainly has had a successful year and shown the positive effect he can have on the atmosphere and energy of the team.
It's really hard to say.
Usually guys have to get on the interview circuit for a year or two before they end up landing that first head job.
But I could definitely see more attention coming his way now.
Tough break for ﻿Billy Winn﻿, considering all he's been through to make it back.
Is the assumption that the recent signing ﻿Anthony Rush﻿ will be active, any expectations for him?
Yeah, the acquisition of Rush turns out to be good timing given Winn's injury.
You hate to see that with Winn, like you said, someone who's been through a whole lot to get back on the field and contribute.
We'll see what the next few weeks bring.
This is not at all criticism, I've really enjoyed watching the team this season.
I'm curious on your thoughts that of the three games so far versus winning teams, that's where two of the three losses have come from.
We all know there are shortfalls on the team, how important will fixing those be to have success against the better teams in the league for the playoffs?
As I said in Inbox this morning, no team plays perfectly clean football, but the Packers have to start reducing the glaring mistakes -- ones that appear highly preventable -- now that we're hitting the stretch run.
The special teams returns, the fumbles, fourth-and-long breakdowns.
That's what they have to clean up.
There are little errors in every game.
Big errors are what get you beat against good teams in the playoffs.
Am I being biased in saying I believe the Packers secondary is extremely underrated and not talked about enough?
When healthy, I'd put our 1-2 combination of ﻿Jaire Alexander﻿ and ﻿Kevin King﻿ against anybody.
Not to mention the coming out party for ﻿Darnell Savage﻿ in recent weeks.
﻿Adrian Amos﻿ just does his thing week in and week out.
The duo of Alexander and King, when they're on the field together, is the best the Packers have had in quite a while, in my opinion.
Amos is a steady-eddie back there, and Savage looks like he's coming into his own lately.
It's a strong group and ﻿Chandon Sullivan﻿ is solid at the nickel too.
Their coverage has led to some of the uptick in sacks.
Coverage and pass rush always go hand in hand, and they're helped when ﻿Rashan Gary﻿ and the Smiths get quick pressure, too.
The Lions always seem to "bring it" against the Pack.
Where are they most dangerous coming into this matchup?
They're dangerous because the cloud has been lifted with the regime change.
It was hanging over them with every loss and it's gone now.
Last week's comeback in Chicago is a huge boost of confidence for that team, and they aren't going to consider themselves out of it at 5-7 when right now the 7 seed in the NFC is 6-6.
The Lions will be jacked up to play on Sunday, I guarantee that, and Stafford can get a hot hand at any time.
Stafford always seems to give us fits.
What's the best way to deal with him?
You have to pressure Stafford into rushing his throws, which can lead to him making risky throws.
But he's got Adrian Peterson behind him to keep the defense honest, so you have to be sound against the run to get Stafford in third down and then get after him.
They've also played a lot of games without Golladay, and I'm not sure what his status will be for this weekend.
He changes their passing game, particularly deep.
Hi Mike - Was thrilled to see your prediction about ﻿Aaron Jones﻿ breaking a big run come true last week -- what a TD!
Any predictions for this week?
Also, what are the Packers best and most difficult matchups against Detroit?
I've already mentioned Peterson and Golladay.
I'd say the other is Hockenson.
He was big on the 96-yard TD drive that started their comeback at Chicago.
Defensively, the Lions have struggled, so I look at this as a game the Packers have to protect the ball and do their thing.
I think the offense can have a big day.
The Bears were struggling like mad on offense and the Lions didn't hold them down much.
Well Aaron Jones has shown that he is a top 5 running back in the league so when do you think Mr.Gutekunst is going to resign him and do you think we are going to franchise tag ﻿Corey Linsley﻿ to have a little more to resign ﻿Jamaal Williams﻿?
I can't really say when the next re-signing will occur.
There's a lot of uncertainty with next year's cap and how to manage all of that.
I do believe the Packers would like to bring Jones back.
I'm sure they'd like Linsley back, too, but affording both after the deals given to Clark and Bakhtiari might be tough.
We'll just have to see.
Who's your dark horse for the playoffs right now that no one is taking seriously enough?
I still think Arizona can be pretty good, even though the Cardinals are on a losing streak right now.
If they rediscover what they had going earlier and get hot these last four games, they could be dangerous.
There's a lot of talent on that roster.
Was happy to see ﻿Dean Lowry﻿ come to life.
That was a strong performance by Lowry.
He's had a quiet year but it would be great to see this be the start of a big finish.
On the OL, did MLF decide to change the alignment and not play ﻿Jon Runyan﻿ or is he nursing an injury?
Sounded like Runyan was going to play vs Eagles.
It did, but LaFleur said after the game they felt the best matchup against Fletcher Cox was ﻿Billy Turner﻿, because he did well against him last year.
So they slid Turner to right guard, and adjusted from there -- which meant ﻿Lucas Patrick﻿ flipping to left guard and ﻿Rick Wagner﻿ coming off the bench to play right tackle.
It was a matchup-based decision.
Are there any updates on ﻿AJ Dillon﻿?
It seems like he's been on the COVID list for a long time.
There have been no updates, other than he was attending practice and observing last week for the first time.
That had to be a good sign.
We'll see what that means for this week.
Which teams would you say have the D-line personnel to generate pressure with their front four (especially those who we might see in the playoffs) and is that still as much of a problem for GB as it was in the past?
In the NFC, I think the Saints and Rams have the strongest defensive fronts that can generate pressure without blitzing.
Those two teams are playing pretty good defense lately, especially the Saints.
Mike, thanks for all the coverage.
I gotta think with the Lions 32nd ranked rushing defense, Williams and Jones should have a great game.
What do you think contributes to the Packers having a great day on the ground on Sunday?
Clean execution and avoiding penalties.
If the Packers are in favorable down and distance -- and not getting behind the sticks due to flags -- the running game should be at their disposal regularly, which then also puts play-action on the table, and Rodgers has been incredible on play-action passes this year.
﻿Kingsley Keke﻿, was the Eagles game a preview of more to come from him?
Seems to be a player on the rise?
We saw the two sacks early in the year at New Orleans, and no more sacks until the Eagles game.
But the coaches have been saying they like what he's been doing, and his work against the run was continuing to improve.
The Eagles have struggled to protect the passer all year, so the Packers did what they should have in that game.
How much it carries over remains to be seen.
After reviewing the film, what happened on the return for a TD?
(The last one where ﻿JK Scott﻿ missed the tackle)
The punt was right down the middle instead of toward the boundary, one of the gunners got washed inside and therefore lost contain, and another coverage player missed a tackle.
Those were the three biggest issues, and Reagor was off to the races.
Does Savage get another pick this week?
When was the last time one player got a pick in three straight?
Williams?
That's a good question.
I'd have to look that one up.
I've watched the Cowboys a couple of times this year and it seems like the D just gives up late in the game.
I feel for McCarthy.
It seems like the team never really bought into him in the HC role.
That defense is a mess, particularly against the run, and when you can't stop the run it's demoralizing.
Who makes the decision as far as fans in the stands at Lambeau?
I know it's been decided already for the regular season, but what about playoffs?
That's a decision made at the top, by Mark Murphy, in consultation with local health experts on the conditions in the community.
It does remain TBA on the playoffs, so they'll continue to monitor things and see what it all looks like in a few more weeks.
Can the Packers be patient with Austin and avoid rushing him into action before he's comfortable?
I think Ervin's latest injury means Austin is going to get the call this week, at least on special teams.
How big a role he'll have on offense right away is harder to say.
Why are MVP awards only based on the player's performance during the regular season?
I would think how a player plays during the playoffs is even more "Valuable" than his regular season performance?
That's the way it's always been, in all the major sports.
It puts everyone on a level playing field to win the award, so it doesn't just become an award for guys who make the playoffs and get to play more games -- though it's very rare an MVP is named on a team that doesn't go to the postseason.
In the Packers' last 7 trips to Ford Field, they've had the lead for 52 minutes of game time (i.e., less than one full game), but they've won 4 out of the 7 games.
Are they used to playing from behind there now?
You could say that.
Even games they've won by double-digit scores have regularly been close until the fourth quarter.
I feel like the last time the Packers just ran away with one there from the start was back on Thanksgiving in '11 or '09, somewhere in there.
"when you can't stop the run it's demoralizing" C'mon, Mike, you're talking to Packer fans here.
Hey, there's struggling to stop the run at times, and then there's the complete inability to stop it -- like the NFC title game last January or the Cowboys last night.
They're two different modes in my mind.
Who is someone that will emerge as an unsung hero by the end of the year?
I'm going with Tavon Austin.
I think he will be used in a variety of plays & make the defense have to prepare for yet another wrinkle in the offense.
Austin is as good a pick as any, but I also think ﻿Allen Lazard﻿ -- who hasn't made a ton of noise since coming back from his injury -- could be due to emerge again.
I realize it's a tough environment to get good intel, but any insight to the story about the pass rushers meeting with Pettine asking for more freedom?
I'm sure the players, and Pettine, will be asked more about that this week.
With media access so limited this year, we have to be patient to find out more.
Two home and two away.
If we keep the formula to win at home and split on the road, that makes 12-4.
That should get the Packers the 2 seed, but it might not get them the 1.
I think the Packers have to run it and get to 13-3, because I could see the Saints losing one game, but I'm not sure about two.
Though you never know.
All right, sorry to cut it a little shorter than normal, but I do have to run.
Thanks for all the questions and enjoy the game Sunday.
I'll be live blogging like always for anyone who wants to join in there.
Take care, Mike

The Green Bay Packers today announced that general seating ticket prices for the 2021 season will remain flat, with per game prices the same as the 2020 season.
Invoices are being sent to Season Ticket Holders this week and will include a brochure outlining the details.
All ticket holders, regardless of whether they applied last year's payment to 2021, will receive an invoice.
Beginning this year, the NFL may move to a 17-game regular-season schedule and a three-game preseason schedule.
While the change has yet to be finalized, it is anticipated that NFC teams and AFC teams would alternate hosting the additional game annually, having either nine home regular-season games and one home preseason game, or eight home regular-season games and two home preseason games.
The NFL is still determining which conference will host the additional game in 2021.
Because the Packers have two ticket packages, the Green and Gold package will take turns receiving either the additional regular-season game or the preseason game.
The Gold package will be first to receive the additional game, and the Green package will receive that year's one preseason game.
When the additional game is hosted for the second time by the NFC, Green package will receive the additional game, and the Gold package will receive that year's one preseason game.
In years when the 17th game is not hosted at Lambeau Field, Green and Gold packages will both remain the same, with each package receiving a preseason game and their ordinary number of regular-season games.
Gold package Season Ticket Holders will receive an invoice for 2021 that reflects the additional home regular-season game and the elimination of the preseason game.
Those who applied their payment from last year to this year will be required to pay the difference between the price of the preseason game and the addition of another home regular-season game.
In the event that Lambeau Field does not host a ninth home regular-season game in 2021, Gold package Season Ticket Holders will receive a refund of the difference between the cost of the regular-season and preseason game.
Green package Season Ticket Holders' invoices will be the same as last year.
Should the COVID-19 pandemic prevent Lambeau Field from hosting fans at full capacity, the Packers will initiate refunds similar to the process in 2020, and Season Ticket Holders will have the chance to opt in or out for the opportunity to purchase tickets if a limited group of fans can be hosted.
If fans are hosted at full capacity, refunds will not be issued and Season Ticket Holders will not have the chance to opt out.
"We're pleased to keep our prices flat this year to reflect that many of our Season Ticket Holders could not attend games last season," Packers President/CEO Mark Murphy said in a letter enclosed with the brochure.
"We are hopeful and optimistic that we'll be able to enjoy games with our Season Ticket Holders at Lambeau Field in 2021, and we look forward to the potential expansion of the NFL regular-season schedule."
Pricing in 2021 is as follows: end zone seats are $58 for preseason, $118 for regular season; south end zone 700 level seats are $61 for preseason, $121 for regular season; south end zone 600 level seats are $64 for preseason, $129 for regular season; end zone to the 20‐yard line seats are $69 for preseason, $134 for regular season; between the 20-yard lines seats are $74 for preseason, $149 for regular season.
Payment is due in the Packers' ticket office by May 14, an extension to the ordinary deadline in consideration of the ongoing pandemic.
Season Ticket Holders are reminded that Lambeau Field is now cashless, and invoices must be paid by credit/debit card or check.
Additionally, "Pay As We Play" continues as the method for both Green and Gold package holders to pay for playoff tickets.

The Packers were in control of the game, lost it, but got it back again when it mattered most.
A key fourth-down stop on defense in the fourth quarter spurred a strong finish on both sides of the ball as the Packers beat the Bears, 35-16, on Sunday at Soldier Field to secure the No.
1 seed for the NFC playoffs.
The Bears trailed just 21-16 and were driving for a possible go-ahead score.
Having converted four times on fourth-and-short on the day, Chicago went for it again on fourth-and-1 from the Green Bay 25 with just over 11 minutes left.
But the Packers finally got the stop they needed, and what followed were a touchdown by ﻿Aaron Jones﻿, an interception by ﻿Adrian Amos﻿ and a record-tying touchdown by ﻿Davante Adams﻿ to put the game away.
"It's never easy in this league and this game was pretty indicative of that," said Head Coach Matt LaFleur after his team matched last year's regular-season record of 13-3.
"For us to be able to deliver in crunch time, that's what it's all about."
For a while, it appeared there might not be a crunch time.
Quarterback ﻿Aaron Rodgers﻿ threw three TD passes on the Packers' three first-half possessions for a 21-13 advantage, and Green Bay was poised to go up by two scores early in the second half on a bomb to ﻿Marquez Valdes-Scantling﻿.
But the third-year receiver, who hauled in a 72-yard touchdown earlier in the game, dropped what would have been a 53-yard score, and suddenly the game shifted in a way that Rodgers called "disjointed" and LaFleur referred to as "strange."
The Bears went into ball-control mode as they drove for a field goal, forced another punt, and then were moving again when the pivotal fourth-and-1 occurred.
The Bears had converted two of those on the drive already, and four on the day.
This time nickel cornerback Chandon Sullivan blanketed the Bears' top receiver, Allen Robinson, on a sprint-out pass to the boundary, and Green Bay maintained its lead.
"I heard a lot of guys on the sideline calling it out … I don't know if he knew it was coming, but he made a hell of a play," LaFleur said of Sullivan.
"That was a big-time play in a big-time moment."
At that point, the Packers faced significant deficits in time of possession and total offensive plays that became 11 minutes (35:29-24:31) and 30 snaps (74-44), respectively, by game's end.
But the offense – which adjusted well once again up front following left tackle David Bakhtiari's injury, with Billy Turner replacing the four-time All-Pro – regained its footing when it had to, foiling the Bears' plan to take Adams out of the game by moving him to the slot and getting him going again.
As he broke Sterling Sharpe's single-season franchise record for receptions with three catches in a span of five plays, Adams set up the Jones score to cap a 12-play, 76-yard march that made it 28-16.
"We spoke it into existence, 'Here's where we put the game away,'" Rodgers said.
"A methodical drive.
We converted some third downs, guys made some plays.
It wasn't splash plays."
Soldier Field hosted a Week 17 matchup between the Green Bay Packers and Chicago Bears on Sunday, Jan. 3, 2021.
Amos then made the splash, picking off Trubisky (33-of-42, 252 yards, 81.7 rating) in Chicago territory, leading to Adams' 18th TD on the year to tie Sharpe's team record in that category and seal the win.
With six catches for 46 yards, Adams finished the regular season with 115 receptions (beating Sharpe by three) for 1,374 yards.
The yardage total fell just shy of his personal 2018 career high (1,386).
Adams' record-tying TD was Rodgers' fourth on the day to give him a new team record of 48 for the season, three better than in his first MVP year of 2011.
He wrapped up the day 19-of-24 for 240 yards and a sparkling 147.9 passer rating.
It's hard to see Rodgers not getting his third MVP after finishing with a career-best 70.7% completion rate, a league-high 48 TDs against just five interceptions, and a league-best 121.5 passer rating that fell just one rating point shy of his single-season NFL record (122.5 in '11).
Defensively, the Packers won the game in the red zone.
After allowing a Montgomery TD run on the first drive of the game, the Bears went 0-for-4 inside the 20 thereafter and scored only via three field goals, including one after the Bears recovered a punt-return fumble by Tavon Austin and started at the Green Bay 20.
"Anytime you hold somebody to 1-for-5 in that area and you're scoring touchdowns, that typically makes a difference," LaFleur said.
"It was really encouraging to see our guys, when we had to, backs up against the wall in the red zone, come through and make some plays.
"That's what it's going to take moving forward.
Just playing complementary football is so important."
The defense set up two TDs with turnovers, as ﻿Jaire Alexander﻿'s forced fumble on tight end Cole Kmet and ﻿Rashan Gary﻿'s recovery in the second quarter preceded Amos' big pick in the fourth.
Green Bay also continued its late-season surge against the run, holding David Montgomery to just 69 yards on 22 carries, yet another good sign heading into the postseason, which will begin for the Packers in two weeks, following a first-round bye.
"I'm really proud of our guys, the way they've answered that challenge, because that was a glaring blemish, if you will, prior to the last couple weeks," LaFleur said of the run defense.
"Our guys have answered it time and time again, and we're going to need to continue to do that because that's playoff football."

Hey everybody, thanks for logging on.
Sorry it's been a while since I did a chat, but I'll try to hop on here and there during the offseason.
So let's get started.
You're married with children.
How did you find time on vacation to read that much?
Ha.
I have a son who's off at grad school, a teenage daughter who would always rather do her own thing, and a wife who likes to fall asleep in the sun.
So reading on vacation is easy.
Mike, With the possibility of losing ﻿Corey Linsley﻿, and not having ﻿David Bakhtiari﻿ to start next season, some are suggesting moving ﻿Elgton Jenkins﻿ to center.
Does that make sense to you?
It's certainly a possibility.
The Packers have a gem in Jenkins and they'll use him where he helps best.
Hey Mike, greetings from Germany!
What do you think about the Watt situation.
Is there a chance?
I'm going to say here what I've been saying every day in Inbox this week.
I don't know.
Hello Mike.
Do you see the Packers are generally an overall conservative team in terms of the administration?
Unwilling to gamble the future for the present in search of a Super Bowl?
The Packers' approach is to be a competitive playoff team as often as for as long as possible.
The more shots you get, the better chance one of those shots pans out.
I think it's the right approach.
Is it frustrating to have been a good team and not gone to the Super Bowl for a decade?
Of course.
They've had some dynamite opportunities and let them get away.
But they've let them get away on the field in my opinion, not in the front office.
Where do the Packers now stand in regard to the salary cap?
They still have work to do to bring their number down, but it hasn't been officially announced yet what the cap will be for 2021, so we'll have to see what happens.
What do you see as the biggest team needs for the draft this year?
The positions that jump out at me first are offensive tackle, defensive line and cornerback, in whatever order.
In 2019 statistically the offense struggled, in 2020 it was the best in the NFL.
Do you expect the Joe Barry defense to have an equally long learning curve?
Two years is not a long learning curve in the NFL.
But I don't see Barry's defense being as big a change schematically as LaFleur's offense was.
How many more roster moves (cuts and pushing out money) should we expect to get ourselves in a good spot cap wise?
I don't have all the Packers' contract info in front of me, but I'm guessing a handful of moves will need to be made, unless the announced cap doesn't turn out to be as low as some were projecting.
Speaking of Linsley, did he have even one bad snap this season?
I don't remember one?
I remember a fumbled exchange with ﻿Aaron Rodgers﻿ on a snap, I think it was at Indy on the opening drive of the game.
Don't know who was more at fault, but that's all I can recall.
Take a look at the best snow photos at Lambeau Field from the 2020 season.

Mike, how similar do you think the hiring of Joe Barry is similar to that of Matt LaFleur in 2019?
His numbers were not exactly the best but he was ideal because of his appealing scheme.
Matt being the Shannahan/McVay, and Barry being Fangio.
I see how you're drawing those parallels.
Coaching isn't just about scheme.
It's also about leadership, the talent supplied, and adjusting to make the most of that talent.
An Inbox question.
Sounds like you finish the Inbox around 4-5 PM for the next day.
What happens to the questions submitted after 5 PM?
Are they automatically carried over to the succeeding day?
Yes, I'll read through them the next day.
When will the 2021 cap be announced!
The new league year officially starts in mid-March, so I'm guessing in the next couple of weeks.
Hi Mike, I respect the hiring of Joe Berry, I just don't understand why coaches in the NFL seem to get more chances from what appears to this outsider a good ol boy network.
It's a high-pressure business and familiarity can breed comfort and confidence.
It's not the answer to everything, but in an unforgiving world I totally understand it.
Any idea what the fans in the stands looks like for 2021?
I planned on a New Orleans trip last season and the football gods smiled upon us this year.
I'd love to be there this year!
I have no idea, but the fact that the Packers got fans in the stands toward the end of the season, and the first regular-season game is still almost seven months away, when our country should be in a different place with the pandemic, hopefully bodes well.
Good morning!
Are your days longer with Wes on vacation or are your days about the same length?
We put in such long hours during the season, I try to keep my offseason days as close to 9-5 as possible unless I absolutely have to work outside those hours.
Not to ask too morbid of a question, but do you think II could survive all that many years with the franchise lights off as they were in the 70s-80s?
What happens when fans used to winning have to adjust?
I don't know, but I hope I'm long gone before I have to find out.
Hello Mike, The D-Bak's contract restructuration is more for making cap room or for being in a better position in FA?
They're sort of one in the same, aren't they?
Any chance Packers are coming to London in 2021?
No idea.
I know the league would like to resume the international games in 2021, but it's wait and see.
I also don't know if any of the Packers' road opponents for next season have any interest in taking a game overseas.
Any guess as to whether or not ﻿Tim Boyle﻿ will be back with GB next season as opposed to trying to get a starting gig with another team?
I don't know what Boyle or the Packers are thinking there.
I could certainly see him wanting to be somewhere there isn't an MVP and a first-round draft pick at the same position, but I can't speak to how much interest other teams might have in him.
If you had to sum up the whole 2020 season in one headline, what would it look like?
For the Packers?
Great year falls short.
For the NFL?
The league pulled it off.
Curious how the restructuring process works?
Does the team contact the player?
Their agent?
Usually all the contact is through the agent.
If you were the GM for a day would you take the Jaguars two firsts and two seconds this year for our starting QB?
No.
I want the current league MVP to continue showing his mastery of this offense and growing within it for a few more years.
Hi Mike!
Do you think Tom Brady is a first ballot hall of famer?
But seriously, what do you think is the problem with the Milwaukee Bucks?
4 losses in a row?
I'll be honest, I don't watch much NBA basketball until the playoffs.
I watch more college basketball during the regular season, and I'd really like to see the Badgers find some sort of hot streak soon.
Do you think when the team is in the red zone next year they might try running ﻿AJ Dillon﻿ instead of pass, pass, pass?
The Packers were outstanding in the red zone all season long, best in the league.
They got away from what they did well on two goal-to-go possessions against Tampa Bay.
Looks like more than ﻿Davante Adams﻿ needs some contract work to get us under the cap.
I don't know anything about anything, but my brief look at the cap tells me 12's contract needs to be reworked or extended.
That's certainly a possibility too.
It wouldn't surprise me at all.
I really like the 2020 taxi squad rules.
When might we see which ones become permanent?
There are a couple of owners' meetings in the spring when I'm sure some of those will be discussed.
They don't really have to have them all worked out until training camps start.
Dear Mike, Any predictions on the Brewers season?
I think it's going to be difficult to stay ahead of the Cardinals in the NL Central now that St. Louis made the deal for Nolan Arenado, but I'm cautiously optimistic the Brewers will be better than the .500 club they were last year.
Hey Mike, thanks again for the chat.
Do you think there would be any sort of benefit to switching from a primary 3-4 to a 4-3 with the personnel we have on the roster?
(I know base is used far less than what the name suggests)
I don't think so, but this league is really about how you line up in nickel anyway.
Who are the six players and how are they aligned in front of the five DBs?
That'll be more important to watch.
Would another way to characterize the Packers' season be, "Once again they snatch defeat from the jaws of victory?"
I don't think you can say that when you're down 28-10 in the NFC title game.
This wasn't 2014.
Same result, similar disappointment, but different path.
Is the cornerback opposite ﻿Jaire Alexander﻿ for the first game of 2021 currently on the roster?
I don't know.
Signing your own is about priorities, and I think it's clear the Packers' priorities would be ﻿Aaron Jones﻿ and Linsley over ﻿Kevin King﻿, but you never know how all this is going to shake out.
Other than ﻿Jordan Love﻿ and the incoming rookies, who do you think a full training camp/preseason will benefit the most this year?
A lot of players from last year's draft class would benefit greatly.
With multiple years remaining on ARs contract are the Packers allowed to add a year with a sizable signing bonus that could effectively cut down on his 2021 cap number?
Sure, as long as Rodgers agrees to it.
I live sports.
Watch and follow, college sports, all pro sports, Nascar.
That being said, when I relax and unwind I get away from that and read Steven King, Dean Koontz, Robin Cook, James Patterson, etc.
I'm surprised with your career sports related you don't "get away" in a good fiction novel.
I did that last year, reading the first three Bourne books by Ludlum.
I enjoyed those, too, and it turned out to be a great choice when the pandemic hit in March.
But I will always love baseball more than fiction.
I just want to give kudos for the Game day Live Blog.
Having two young daughters, it can be a challenge to give full attention to a Packers game in real time.
Am I the only one that goes back and reads the entire Live Game blog to get your perspective after the game is over?
I don't know.
I'm not even sure if I could follow all my random thoughts and musings after the fact.
Have all the compensatory draft picks been handed out yet?
Do we know what the Packers will receive?
Nothing official yet, but projections have the Packers getting three extra picks -- one each in the fourth, fifth and sixth rounds I believe.
I think LaFleur is still a bit too conservative when it comes to crunch time.
He had only been an OC for 3 years.
He seems to learn from his mistakes, but I get tired of his "I should have done this or that."
Trust me, it's not just younger coaches who feel that way after a game.
I admire his ability to be honest publicly with such thoughts.
Not all coaches are like that, even if they often feel the same way inside.
I know one person seldom makes the difference on a team, but I can't help think we might be holding the trophy if Bakhtiari doesn't get hurt.
That's just another random element to this game and especially the postseason.
Five sacks from the edge rushers after a season in which Rodgers was only sacked 20 times in 16 games ... the Packers weren't at their best, however you want to look at it.
Do the Packers ever pick up a free agent to create momentum or excitement, like in the case of JJ Watt?
This team doesn't make personnel acquisitions for PR reasons or to sell tickets.
It's not how they operate.
Do you think with Rodgers wanting to take every second to read the defense, that they still have the ability to run a good hurry-up offense?
Haven't seen that in a few years.
I have no doubt they could.
The Packers were still plenty good in two-minute situations this year.
They just didn't have many end-of-game scenarios where it was needed.
Rodgers usually calls his own plays in two-minute anyway.
I can't decide which MLB I like more, ﻿Krys Barnes﻿ or ﻿Kamal Martin﻿.
Which MLB are you more excited about for next season?
I'm excited for both, but I'd say Barnes impressed me more as a rookie.
I think the question with both is where the ceiling is.
We don't know yet.
Steve's criticism of LaFleur is misguided.
I find it refreshing that that MLF is willing to be honest and look in the mirror for blame and improvement.
I think all coaches do that to some degree.
What's different about LaFleur is he'll do it publicly, which I think the players in the locker room respect.
It does get frustrating.
"We shouldn't have gotten away from the run."
Then next time, "We shouldn't have gotten away from the run."
Well, who's in charge?
Next time just run the dang ball.
That falls on both the play caller and the QB.
Next year the team that can't win an NFC championship game will win the SB against a team that can't win the SB.
(Green Bay vs. Buffalo)...you heard it here first!
!
All righty then.
And we'll let that be the last word for today.
Thanks for all the participation folks, and we can do this again in a couple of weeks or so.
Take care, all the best.
--Mike

The Green Bay Packers are bringing back another contributor from the 2020 season.
In a pair of Instagram stories posted to his official account on Friday, defensive back Will Redmond strongly suggested he is in Green Bay to re-sign with the Packers.
The second story showed Redmond entering the parking lot at Lambeau Field.
It’s likely Redmond is taking a physical with the team before the official announcement is made.
With Redmond back in the fold, the Packers will now return 14 of their top 15 players in defensive snaps from last season.
Redmond, 27, has played in 31 games with the Packers over the last three seasons, including 26 of a possible 32 games since 2019.
A backup safety, Redmond was on the field for 340 defensive snaps in 2020.
He’s also a core special teams player, with over 400 total special teams snaps logged over the last two seasons.
According to the team, Redmond led the Packers with nine special teams tackles in 2019.
In the NFC title game in January, Redmond dropped what could have been a game-changing interception of Tom Brady right before halftime.
Redmond joins running back Aaron Jones, cornerback Kevin King, tight end Marcedes Lewis and defensive lineman Tyler Lancaster among the free agents re-signed by the Packers this offseason.

Free agent offensive lineman Lane Taylor visited his second team since the start of the new league year.
According to the league's transaction wire, Taylor – a starter for the Green Bay Packers to open the 2020 season – visited the Houston Texans on Monday.
Taylor visited the San Francisco 49ers last month.
Both teams likely want to check in on his recovery from the ACL injury he suffered in Week 1 of last year.
Taylor took a pay cut and returned to the Packers in 2020, and a strong summer earned him the starting job at right guard.
He was lost...
Daniel Jeremiah's latest mock draft for NFL.com has the Green Bay Packers getting help for the interior of the offensive line in the first round.
Jeremiah sent Alabama offensive lineman Landon Dickerson to the Packers at No.
29 overall.
From Jeremiah: "Dickerson is the best pure interior offensive linemen available.
I thought he might fall out of the first round after his ACL injury, but it appears his recovery is going smoothly.
He can step in following the departure of Corey Linsley."
Dickerson is Jeremiah's No.
40 overall prospect in the draft class, mostly due to injuries.
He suffered a torn...
The first episode of Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers hosting "Jeopardy!"
aired Monday.
The three-time MVP has nine more episodes airing over the next two weeks.
How did Rodgers do during his opening appearance?
It's time to go to the tape to evaluate the performance.
Here's a light-hearted breakdown of Rodgers' first episode as guest host (note: spoilers ahead):
– Solid intro.
Looks confident, ready for the moment.
Possibly too much swaying back and forth.
He might be fighting some nerves, and that's just fine.
– Terrific job reading the opening categories.

The Green Bay Packers re-signed RB ﻿Aaron Jones﻿.
The transaction was announced Friday by General Manager Brian Gutekunst.
Jones, who was originally selected by the Packers in the fifth round of the 2017 NFL Draft, has played in 54 games with 42 starts over the past four seasons.
He has recorded 3,364 yards and 37 rushing touchdowns on 651 carries (5.2 avg.)
and hauled in 131 receptions for 1,057 yards (8.1 avg.)
and six TDs.
Jones is one of only two players in league history to post 3,000-plus rushing yards and 35-plus rushing TDs with an average of 5.00-plus yards per carry in their first four seasons in the NFL, joining RB Jim Brown (1957-60).
Jones is one of three players in the NFL to post 2,000-plus rushing yards and 25-plus rushing TDs over the past two seasons (Derrick Henry, Dalvin Cook) and is the first Packer to hit those marks over a two-season span since FB Jim Taylor (1962-63).
Jones has also started all four postseason games he has played, registering 244 rushing yards and four TDs on 53 carries (4.6 avg.)
with 11 receptions for 52 yards (4.7 avg.)
and a TD.

Packers team historian
Chuck from Richfield, WI
I loved Mike's nugget on how the Bears have enacted a self-fulfilling prophecy of doom by having 14 retired jersey numbers and banning the retirement of more in the future!
I think our six retired jerseys are appropriate with Aaron Rodgers soon-to-be seven.
I thought the Packers would retire Curly Lambeau's No.
1 jersey during the 100-year team anniversary.
Any insights why not?
I can't recall even one player in my lifetime who has ever worn jersey No.
1 for the green and gold.
Wes has deferred the question to you about Paul Hornung's No.
5 and Lambeau's No.
1.
First, I agree with Mike and Wes about the Packers taking a more selective approach to retiring numbers.
The fewer the better with Rodgers, as you noted, being next on the list.
It should be the ultimate honor that a team bestows on one of its players.
But harsh reality is that during their lean years in the 1950s and again in the 1970s and '80s, the Packers were not only losers on the field, but there also was no end to the off-the-field blunders committed by their general managers, head coaches and corporate officers.
How they handled their retired numbers was a prime example and why their decisions have been a source of controversy for more than 65 years.
Let's take them one by one.
Don Hutson's number was the first to be retired, but what would figure to be a special moment turned into an afterthought.
On Dec. 2, 1951, six years after he played his last game, Hutson's No.
14 was hastily retired at halftime of a game against the New York Yanks at old City Stadium.
After Hutson and five other Packers greats were given blankets for their selection to the now defunct Helms Athletic Foundation Hall of Fame, a reenactment of the Arnie Herber-to-Hutson passing combination and the presentation of a scroll by Green Bay Mayor Dominic Olejniczak to Hutson, second-year coach Gene Ronzani with little fanfare and few words handed Hutson a No.
14 jersey to symbolize the retirement of his number only moments before the start of the second half.
The next day, Lee Remmel, then writing for the Green Bay Press-Gazette, devoted one sentence to the retirement of Hutson's jersey deep into his sidebar on the game.
A year later, a group of fans scheduled Tony Canadeo Day for the Packers-Dallas Texans game on Nov. 23, and announced they planned to retire his No.
3 in a pregame ceremony.
It was Canadeo's 11th and final season, and his final home game.
On game day, Canadeo was given a Chevrolet station wagon, a television set, a champagne bucket and a scroll of the names of the fans who donated to the cause.
But there was no ceremony or mention of his number being retired.
Why not?
I could find no explanation in the Packers' corporate minutes of executive committee and board of directors meetings or anywhere else.
But I think I found a clue in a Press-Gazette story that ran a little more than two weeks before the game.
The paper made it clear that Tony Canadeo Day was being organized by fans with the Packers' blessing, but it "is not sponsored by the Packers."
Canadeo was certainly an outstanding player, but maybe more so an all-out competitor and fan favorite.
Organizers of the event admitted they were paying tribute to him "because he had always given something extra on the field in addition to giving Packers fans something to yell about" during hard times.
What's more, I think it can be safely assumed that Tony Canadeo Day and the halftime show when Hutson was honored were held during late-season games against two one-win teams – the Yanks finished 1-9-2; the Texans, 1-11 – to try and boost the size of the crowds when the Packers were struggling to survive, maybe more so than for any other reason.
Attendance for the 1951 game against the Yanks was 14,297, almost 11,000 below capacity; while the crowd for Tony Canadeo Day was only 16,340.
Here's another educated guess about why Canadeo's number wasn't retired as planned.
Charlie Mathys was the Packers' starting quarterback for most of four seasons in the 1920s, an influential member of the board of directors for more than 50 years after he retired and essentially a lifelong resident of Green Bay who never missed a game into the 1970s.
Mathys told Remmel in the 1960s that he considered Verne Lewellen, a former teammate, the greatest player in Packers history.
Jug Earp, who played for the Packers from 1922-32, was the team's director of public relations when Hutson's number was retired and Canadeo's wasn't.
He played almost his entire career with Lewellen, who was also a member of the Packers' board at the time of those events.
Several other former Packers greats who stayed in the Green Bay area and were former teammates of fullback Clarke Hinkle and Hutson also went on record after Canadeo retired saying they believed Hinkle was the greatest player in Packers history.
This is pure speculation, but my hunch is that the fans' plan to retire Canadeo's number met with considerable resistance from alumni and others.
But if that was the case, why is No.
3 retired today?
Two years later, Canadeo was a salesman and stopped to watch a training camp practice in Stevens Point, Wis., when he spotted No.
1 draft pick Veryl Switzer wearing No.
3 and "nearly swooned" in the words of the Press-Gazette's Art Daley.
Trainer Bud Jorgensen assured Canadeo that Switzer would be reassigned No.
27 before the season started.
In early March 1955, less than a year later, Canadeo was elected to the Packers' board and then, three years later, to the executive committee, where he was a strong voice and respected member through the 1990s, when the Packers first published their list of retired numbers.
Let's not forget, too, that Vince Lombardi, Canadeo's good friend, issued No.
3 to kicker Ben Agajanian for the final four regular-season games and the NFL championship in 1961.
"… Vince didn't give a damn," Canadeo said years later.
However, Lombardi cared enough about the honor to announce on July 10, 1967, at the Packers' annual press party, that he was retiring Hornung's No.
5.
Remmel covered the event for the Press-Gazette and quoted Lombardi as saying: "I might say in this connection we will not have a number five this year, and so far as I'm concerned, there will never be another number five in Green Bay."
What's more, Remmel did not equivocate in his story.
He flatly stated that Hornung joined Hutson and Canadeo as the only Packers to have their numbers retired.
"The 31-year-old Golden Boy is the first player to be so honored in Lombardi's regime, now in its ninth season," Remmel wrote.
The eight-column headline over his story read: "Vince Tabs Hyland Potential Starter; Retires Paul's '5'".
However, the Milwaukee Sentinel and Milwaukee Journal and many other Wisconsin papers ran Ken Hartnett's Associated Press story on the press conference and that seems to have created some confusion.
On one hand, Hartnett also unequivocally wrote, Hornung's number "will be retired."
But the Lombardi quote in his story differed from Remmel's.
According to Hartnett, Lombardi said, "As long as I'm in Green Bay, No.
5 will not be used."
My apologies if all these twists and turns are wearing you out, but the story doesn't end here.
Six years later, the Packers drafted quarterback Jerry Tagge in the first round.
He had worn No.
14 at Nebraska and was assigned it before the start of training camp.
Former teammates of Hutson and longtime fans objected, claiming No.
14 was retired.
But not surprisingly, considering the actual act of retiring Hutson's number might not have lasted two minutes, nobody could remember when.
Hutson said he thought his number was retired by Curly Lambeau shortly after he quit playing in 1945 and some of his teammates echoed the same belief.
Why Lambeau didn't retire Hutson's number before his bitter divorce from the Packers in early 1950 is a mystery.
Anyway, at that point, coach and general manager Dan Devine had members of the organization research the subject.
Their findings?
No official record of the Packers' retired numbers existed in the team's Lambeau Field offices.
They also found that other players had been assigned the number in training camp over the previous 20 years, but nobody had worn it in a game that counted.
As a result, Devine said he was convinced Hutson's number was retired.
Tagge was given No.
17 instead.
"Hutson's Number Retired by Packers, for 2nd Time," was the headline over sportswriter Terry Bledsoe's story in the Journal.
"As far as informal historians can remember, Hutson's number is the only one formally retired by the Packers, although Vince Lombardi made a singlehanded retirement (of Hornung's) when he was coach and general manager of the club," Bledsoe wrote.
Highly respected by peers in the newspaper field and also well thought of in NFL circles, which later landed him jobs with the NFL Management Council, as assistant general manager of the New York Giants and as GM of the Buffalo Bills, Bledsoe had investigated the subject well enough to get the story right, a true rarity at the time.
A year later, the Packers acquired veteran receiver Dick Gordon on waivers from the Los Angeles Rams, and he requested No.
5.
But, reportedly, veteran equipment manager Dad Braisher refused to give it to Gordon because of Lombardi's decree.
Only a week earlier, the Packers also had officially retired Bart Starr's No.
15, finally with a proper ceremony.
Thus, the retired number controversy was topical again.
"That brought the question: How many other numbers have the Packers retired?"
the Journal's Chuck Johnson asked.
"No one seems to know for sure.
Maybe everybody's lost count."
Remmel disagreed.
Despite writing seven years earlier that the numbers worn by Hornung and Canadeo had been retired, Remmel now backtracked in his "Personality Parade" column, where he stated "only one number ever had been officially retired … '14.'"
In 1985, Forrest Gregg gave over-the-hill quarterback Vince Ferragamo No.
5 with two games remaining in the season.
Ferragamo also wore it in 1986.
Gregg, who had to know but never corrected the false statement that Lombardi had called him his finest player, said he had no problem unretiring Hornung's number after 20 years.
"It's fine with me," Gregg answered when he was quizzed about it.
"We need to revive No.
5.
Maybe some of that charisma of Paul Hornung's will rub off on the rest of us."
Was jealousy a factor in Gregg's decision?
Only he would know.
But Lombardi actually had called Hornung the "greatest player I ever coached" in a widely covered speech; whereas Gregg, during the 10 years since he was hired as coach in Cleveland, had lived the lie about something Lombardi never said – or at least I've yet to find any evidence of Lombardi ever saying anything of the kind, at least publicly about Gregg.
In 1987, Gregg issued No.
5 to both rookie quarterback Don Majkowski and strike-replacement quarterback Willie Gillus.
Majkowski, at least, had enough appreciation for Packers history that he asked to switch to No.
7 before his second season out of respect for Hornung.
However, that made no difference to Lindy Infante, who seemed to care less about the Packers' great history, during his four-year stay.
In 1988, he gave No.
5 to kicker Curtis Burrow, whose career lasted all of one game.
In 1990, the Packers listed their retired numbers in their media guide for what appears to be the first time.
The list included Canadeo's No.
3, as well as 14, 15 and Ray Nitschke's No.
66, which was retired in 1983.
Hornung's No.
5 wasn't included.
Remmel was the Packers' executive director of PR at the time, but I'm not sure if he had a say in the decision or not.
Regretfully, I never asked him.
If he did, it marked the third time he had changed his mind about Nos.
3 and 5.
It would be another 13 years before the retired numbers were first displayed on the façade in the north end zone of Lambeau Field following the 2003 completion of the stadium's renovation.
Again, Canadeo's number was included, but not Hornung's.
Bob Harlan was president when the numbers were first printed in the media guide and also when they were unveiled inside the stadium, but he said he couldn't remember why Canadeo's number was included and not Hornung's.
Lou from Kohler, WI
I consider it a shame that the Packers did not retire Paul Hornung' No.
5 before he passed away in accordance with Vince Lombardi's wishes.
It reminds me of MLB not putting Ron Santo into the HOF before he passed, but right afterwards, which was a crime.
I agree.
If Canadeo's No.
3 is retired, then Hornung's No.
5 should be, too.
There's little difference between the two circumstances.
If anything, Lombardi, while he was still coach and general manager, officially announced Hornung's number was being retired, whereas I've never seen any official announcement by anyone associated with the Packers that Canadeo's number was being retired.
I fully understand Mark Murphy's reluctance to do what wasn't done in 1990 and 2003.
He had nothing to do with turning what should have been a sacred honor into a perpetual debate, if not an unforgiving screwup.
As I've told him and others, I believe he has done more to preserve the great history of the Packers franchise than any president in team history.
His instructions to me from the beginning and through the Packers Hall of Fame renovation, the Lambeau art project, the "Legacy" documentary, our 100th season celebration and, most recently, our book on the definitive history of the Packers have never changed: Just make sure you get our history right.
Sadly, it had become a muddled mess over the years, although I want to make clear I'm not casting aspersions on Remmel, who covered or worked for the Packers for more than 60 years and was our first official historian.
Lee and I talked about this often.
He admitted he never did any research on early Packers history and just took the word of Lambeau and George Calhoun, the Packers' co-founder and his former co-worker at the Press-Gazette, even though he admitted that Lambeau couldn't be trusted to tell the truth.
Lee had a great memory and knew what he had lived, which was many more years of Packers history than I can claim.
At the same time, Lee was a minimalist when it came to writing about early Packers history because he also knew what he didn't know.
Lee was a stickler for accuracy when I worked with him at the Press-Gazette, and, more than anything, he was a storyteller.
Believe me, I'll always be indebted to him for the countless stories he shared with me.
But back to Hornung's number.
I think we're all fortunate that the Packers' general managers since 1992 – Ron Wolf, Ted Thompson and Brian Gutekunst – have had a great appreciation for Packers history and have not issued No.
5 to any player during the regular season, obviously with the blessings of Harlan and Murphy.
In fact, Wolf claims he did retire it.
He told me he instructed Red Batty and his equipment staff to never issue No.
5.
I'm not into curses, but it has crossed my mind that the "Curse of No.
5" might be why the Packers suffered three of their most inept seasons when Gregg and Infante issued it to borderline players and have won the Vince Lombardi Trophy only twice since he died.
After all, Lombardi considered Hornung his greatest player and who would know better than him?
In fact, I'm not so sure if he had lived and run the Packers for another decade or more if he would have retired any other number.
I have little doubt, he'd be deeply dismayed if he could see the north wall in Lambeau Field with no No.
5 – his wishes ignored.
Sam from Antigo, WI
What is the story on jersey No.
1?
It is never issued.
Why?
No.
1 was worn by Lambeau in 1925 and '26.
Nobody wore it before and nobody has worn it since.
But how many players have you seen on other teams wearing No.
1?
Or even other low-single-digit numbers?
Charlie Mathys wore No.
2 in 1925-26 and nobody else wore it until it was given to Mason Crosby in 2007.
No.
4 was last worn by blocking quarterback Herm Schneidman in 1937 and not again until backup quarterback Chuck Fusina wore it in 1986.
End Ray Riddick wore No.
5 in 1940-41 and then nobody wore it until Hornung in 1957.
If anybody remembers these two names, you're a cinch to win Packers' Jeopardy.
Back Mal Bross wore No.
6 for two games in 1927 and the next player to wear it was punter Ryan Flinn for two games in 2005.
When I was kid and first started following the Packers from the mid-1950s to mid-1960s, nobody wore single-digit numbers.
Besides Hornung's No.
5, the only other player to wear one was Agajanian in 1961.
I might have known from pictures that Packers Hall of Famer Bob Forte wore No.
8 from 1946-53, but that was really before my time.
I know some people have pitched in recent years for Lambeau's number to be retired, but I can't remember anyone ever bringing that subject up until the last 10 years or so.
Lambeau wore No.
1 for only two years and he was on the downside of his career when he did.
Keep in mind, too, he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame as a coach only.
I think the Hall got it wrong, considering George Halas was inducted as both a player and coach.
But I'm not sold on retiring Lambeau's number.
If having your number retired is the ultimate honor for a player, having a stadium named after you is the ultimate honor multiple times squared.
Plus, there's a giant-sized statue of Lambeau at the stadium's entrance.
In his case, retiring his number would almost be insignificant by comparison.
But some of the stories are whoppers
But no, they didn't win division in 1982
George Calhoun joining the Press-Gazette ushered in an era of unabashed promotions
President Robert Parins and the executive committee didn't stop him from hiring Ron Wolf
Defense, running game and special teams all stood out that year
Vince Lombardi predicted greatness for one of the Packers' biggest, fastest backs ever

Free agent offensive lineman Lane Taylor visited his second team since the start of the new league year.
According to the league’s transaction wire, Taylor – a starter for the Green Bay Packers to open the 2020 season – visited the Houston Texans on Monday.
Taylor visited the San Francisco 49ers last month.
Both teams likely want to check in on his recovery from the ACL injury he suffered in Week 1 of last year.
Taylor took a pay cut and returned to the Packers in 2020, and a strong summer earned him the starting job at right guard.
He was lost for the season during the team’s season-opening win over the Minnesota Vikings at U.S. Bank Stadium.
A return to Green Bay still makes sense, especially after the Packers lost center Corey Linsley, but his recent injury history has to be considered.
Now 31, Taylor is coming off back-to-back seasons with a season-ending injury.
He had a torn biceps after three games in 2019.
Taylor has played in 79 games with 50 starts for the Packers since entering the NFL in 2013.
He has started at both guard spots and left tackle.

The first episode of Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers hosting "Jeopardy!"
aired Monday.
The three-time MVP has nine more episodes airing over the next two weeks.
How did Rodgers do during his opening appearance?
It's time to go to the tape to evaluate the performance.
Here's a light-hearted breakdown of Rodgers' first episode as guest host (note: spoilers ahead):
– Solid intro.
Looks confident, ready for the moment.
Possibly too much swaying back and forth.
He might be fighting some nerves, and that's just fine.
– Terrific job reading the opening categories.
Noted the quotations, emphasized key or interesting words.
Sounds like...
Aaron Rodgers' first episode as the guest host of "Jeopardy!"
included a playful jab at the Green Bay Packers by a contestant during the Final Jeopardy round.
Scott, the two-day champion, didn't have an answer for the final clue, so he wrote down something he knew would get a reaction from Rodgers, the MVP quarterback who is hosting 10 episodes over the next two weeks.
"Who wanted to kick that field goal?"
The answer is, of course, in reference to Matt LaFleur's decision to kick a field goal down eight points late in the fourth quarter against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in...
Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers might not be satisfied with just a two-week guest-hosting experience on "Jeopardy!"
In fact, the three-time MVP is legitimately interested in becoming the full-time host and successor to Alex Trebek, who hosted the show for 37 seasons.
Rodgers told "The Pat McAfee Show" on Monday that he would "love to be the host" of the iconic game show.
And he wasn't just kidding around.
Rodgers is working under the assumption that he could continue to be an NFL quarterback while hosting the show.
Here's what Rodgers said to Claire McNear of The Ringer: "I don’t...

Hey everybody, thanks for logging on a little early today.
I had to bump the chat up because of the football team's schedule.
Today is "Thursday" in a game prep week (game Saturday) so I appreciate the adjustment.
Let's get to it.
Thanks for a great year of chats Mike!
Any idea of changes on special teams for the first playoff game?
ST has been the weak link for sure so hoping something changes.
I wouldn't anticipate anything drastic.
The special teams have proven they can do it, and they have veteran leaders who have been at this a while.
They just need to come together as a unit and be on top of their game, which means everyone doing his job.
Obviously ﻿Aaron Jones﻿ is one of the best RBs in the league at this point, but ﻿AJ Dillon﻿ can certainly be a force as well.
Any indication how ML will manage the running game since it will be needed against the Rams defensive line.
Really hard to say.
When the Packers had all three backs for the Bears game, they only ran 44 offensive plays, so Dillon didn't get as much playing time as anticipated.
We did see both Jones and Dillon on the field together for a few snaps in that game, though, so I'd keep an eye on that.
The media has been giving a lot of attention to Ramsey and Donald, deservedly so.. Is there anybody else on the Rams defense that can have an impact that isn't so well known?
The corner opposite Ramsey, Darious Williams, had the pick-six at Seattle and has had a really good season.
Ramsey is the All-Pro, but Williams is a tough customer, too.
Up front, Michael Brockers and Leonard Floyd can get after the QB as well.
Spoff!
You have had quite a career how many play-off games is this for you now?
Would love to hear your favorite playoff covering memory ok I'll hang up and listen LOL!
I hadn't counted them up until just now, but I believe this is my 21st postseason game for packers.com, and the 25th of my sports writing career.
My favorite memory was probably the first playoff game I covered, the '96 divisional vs. San Fran, the mud game.
That was in my newspaper days, and it was quite the scene going into a mud-filled locker room afterward to interview players.
Rams offensive playmakers.
Who are they, and who will they line up against?
Akers at RB, Woods and Cupp at WR, Higbee at TE are the main ones.
I'm not sure how the Packers will match up on the perimeter, but slowing down Akers is the biggest key.
This Rams offense is tough when it gets the play-action game going.
If you can slow down the run, the play-action won't mean as much.
Are you buying what the Rams are selling on their rhetoric for Aaron Donald?
a rib/oblique injury is certainly significant isn't it?
It sure looked like it last Saturday, but I have no idea what a week of recovery will do for something like that.
It's hard to imagine Donald being 100%, but Donald at 80% is still a whale of a football player, I would imagine.
In your opinion, who is the better matchup for the Packers defense?
Wolford or Goff?
I don't think that matters too much, really.
The scheme is predicated on play-action to make the QB successful, which is why clamping down on the run is the key defensively.
Seattle couldn't contain Akers and they had a hard time defensively even though Goff completed less than half his passes.
Mike, The Rams beating Seattle; more a product of being a familiar opponent or just being a better team?
They were better on that day, which can happen anytime, but especially against a familiar/division foe.
That was their third time playing Seattle and second time in three weeks.
It felt like the same type of thing unfolded, albeit in a little wilder fashion, in the Cleveland-Pittsburgh game.
Hey Mike I appreciate your WYMM last week - do you see anything on the tape for this week's match up with the Rams that you will watch for on Saturday?
Anything us common fans should keep an eye out for?
Both of these QBs like to use the play-action bootleg or rollout.
It's a staple of both offenses.
Both defenses should know how to defend it.
I'm curious if either team will be able to make that play effective.
Hi Mike, I know everyone is excited and the adrenaline is pumping.
Wild card weekend saw some unnecessary and foolish penalties that can really pump the brakes on a team's momentum.
Do the coaches show the players replays of those incidents (stumping on logos, swinging punches, shoving in the back out of retaliation) and talk about keeping their emotions and pride in check?
They certainly talk about it.
I think the fact the Packers were in this same position last year, with mostly the same team, will help in that regard.
They know these playoff games are going to feature momentum swings, sometimes severely.
You have to play with emotion but stay in control at the same time.
How much time do you think ﻿Jared Veldheer﻿ will need to integrate changes since his last stint with us?
In other words, could he play this weekend?
I'm sure they'll get him ready to fill in at tackle if someone goes down.
LaFleur hasn't said anything specific, but I don't think he was signed in order to just walk in and start.
Hey Mike, how are you?
I noticed recent playoff history favors the #1 defense.
Am I the only one worried about this match-up?
Sure, it will be cold, but I fully expect the Rams to come and play hard.
I love the Pack and I will never doubt their ability, but I cannot get over how tough of a game this will most likely turn out to be.
Thanks!
Nothing's easy at this stage.
The Rams have the No.
1 scoring defense, but the Packers have the No.
1 offense and have scored points against some pretty good defenses this season.
If the Packers do what they do best, which is protect the ball and score TDs in the red (gold) zone, I think that's how they win the game.
Do you still cover the games in person with Wes or do they make you work at home?
We cover the home games from the stadium.
We're just in a suite -- me, Wes and Ryan, our social media manager -- with our computers set up.
Did you save some mud?
Sort of like dirt from the mound after a no-hitter.
Ha, no.
It wasn't pretty, I'll say that.
With the impressive defensive line of the Rams, will screens and short crossing patterns be more effective than five-step drop backs looking for deep balls?
I think it's about keeping the passing game on time, which is get the ball out in rhythm.
If the Packers can run the ball, set up play-action, and keep things in rhythm, they can be effective.
Then it's just a matter of finishing the good drives -- which will be fewer in the playoffs -- in the end zone.
How healthy are ﻿Corey Linsley﻿ and ﻿Rick Wagner﻿?
Do we have a sense other than injury designation?
It sounds like the Packers are in good shape, health-wise.
Linsley is not even on the injury report and Wagner was listed as limited yesterday.
The only player who didn't practice at all Tuesday was ﻿Kingsley Keke﻿, who's still in the concussion protocol.
I know anything can happen in a playoff game (see Steelers vs. Browns) but I just can't see the Rams one dimensional offense scoring more than 20 on the Packers D and the Rams D holding the Packers to less than 20+.
Am I seeing this game through green and gold colored glasses?
I don't know if I'd put the specific numbers on it, but turnovers are the great equalizer and that's why the Packers have to continue protecting the ball the way they did.
The Rams were minus-3 in turnover margin in the regular season, an anomaly for a 10-win team.
They won the turnover battle in Seattle 2-0.
It was a huge factor in that game, with the pick-six being the big highlight of course.
Do you think they'll amp up ﻿Allen Lazard﻿ against the Rams?
Seems like they've limited him in snaps since he's came back from his core surgery.
Assuming Ramsey is on ﻿Davante Adams﻿ most of the time, I'll be curious when the Packers go three wide if ﻿Jamaal Williams﻿ takes Lazard or ﻿Marquez Valdes-Scantling﻿.
I don't know what ﻿Aaron Rodgers﻿ will consider a favorable matchup, but he'll be watching it all closely.
Does the early time slot help the Rams a little with the weather?
What's the difference between Jan. afternoon Lambeau and Jan. evening Lambeau?
Maybe a few degrees.
The high is around 30 or low 30s on Saturday.
With kickoff at 3:35, the temps will start dropping in the second half but I don't think they'll drop more than 6-8 degrees or so.
Mike, any indications that Ramsey will shadow Davante even in the slot?
Hoping LaFleur won't be too cute and attacks early and often.
That's the question everyone's waiting to see, if Ramsey will take Adams when he's in the slot.
There's no way to know for sure.
The Packers will have a plan for both scenarios.
I notice ﻿Jaire Alexander﻿ seems to lock down whoever lines up on his side of the field during games, then late in the Bears matchup I noticed he was following Robinson even into the slot at times.
Do you think they will have him trail the #1 receiver wherever they go more often moving forward?
I think that depends on the opposing offense and somewhat on the flow of the game at that point.
Pettine knows he can ask Alexander to do anything, so he'll use him in whatever way makes the overall defense strongest.
I assume Jalen Ramsey will slow down Davante at least a little bit.
If so, who do you think steps up big elsewhere?
The Packers have struggled offensively when a team (Panthers comes to mind) limit Adams.
The Packers have taken advantage of what presents itself on offense.
MVS can win a matchup deep, Lazard can do damage on shallow crosses if there's too much attention on Adams, and ﻿Robert Tonyan﻿ has 11 TD catches, so he's a major red-zone threat.
We haven't seen the running backs catch much out of the backfield lately, but I would expect that to be a big part of the game plan too, especially if the Rams are hell-bent on taking Adams away.
Any word on ﻿Tyler Ervin﻿ or ﻿Raven Greene﻿?
Neither has been activated from IR at this point.
McVay vs. LaFleur, do either of them have an advantage over the other, or does their familiarity cancel out?
I always feel like that cuts both ways.
I thought it was interesting yesterday LaFleur admitted maybe he thought too much about the familiarity last year with Shanahan, Saleh and his brother.
I think his message was you prep more for the team you see on the field, not so much the guys calling the plays.
Over/under for number of snaps for ﻿Damon Harrison﻿?
I'd guess he plays at least 20, maybe more, this week, if the Rams try to run the ball as much as I think they're going to.
Would you say if we score 28-30 points against this defense, then we probably will win?
Yes.
The Rams give up 18.5 per game.
If the Packers top that by 10, I think that spells victory.
If the Packers win on Saturday, who would you root for on Sunday?
My sense is NO has a slightly better offense but TB has a slightly better defense.
I honestly wouldn't have a rooting interest either way.
I think the Buccaneers are a really hot team right now, but I'm not discounting the Saints.
I just don't know what to make of them because they had an easy time with a Bears team that wasn't really playoff-caliber.
I know just making the playoffs is the goal every year and hope for some luck, but this year is the first time since 2011 I feel we have a really solid chance at the crown.
I think we have played to our seeds pretty much other years, did you have high hopes ever in 2012-19?
I thought the '14 team was a really good one, but I knew going to Seattle would be a big chore.
This is the Packers' best team since '14, by far, in my opinion.
Will we see more six-man fronts like in the Titans game?
I would imagine that formula may work well again, tempting the Rams to throw on 1st and 2nd down with a middle-tier QB.
I'm not sure what Pettine has planned, but I would bet he's got different run-stopping packages to call on if the Rams get things going in that regard.
How much longer do the Packers have Jaire under contract?
Next year is the final year of Alexander's rookie deal, but they'll also have the fifth-year option, which I would assume they'd exercise this spring.
Did you have any predictions in the offseason that turned out to be true compared to other analysts who were dead wrong saying the Packers would take a downturn?
I thought all along the Packers were the team to beat in the NFC North.
I didn't understand how anyone could see it differently.
Beyond that, I really didn't know because I don't know other teams as closely.
But I was confident the Packers were the best team in the division, and then after Week 1 at Minnesota I was sure of it.
Do you think LaFleur will attempt fewer of the run alert receiver screens this week, since the Seahawks had one picked off to the house last week against the Rams?
We saw the difference a pick six makes on Rodgers and the Pack against Tampa earlier this season and I don't want us to have a playoff game pan out the same way.
Those run alerts are up to Rodgers based on how the corners are lining up outside.
The pick-six was on a called WR screen by Seattle, I believe, not a run alert that was at the QB's discretion.
At least that's how I saw it in real time.
Hey Mike, do you expect the Rams to start Wolford over Goff again, in case he is ready to go?
Well, I've been wondering if they'd go back to Wolford, if he's cleared to go, just because of that thumb of Goff's in the cold.
But yesterday's estimated injury report for LA (they had a walk-through, not a full practice) listed Wolford as not participating and Goff as full.
So at this point, it sure looks like Goff, but I still say you never know.
Will the play of Brady vs. Brees be the deciding factor?
Both those teams have good defenses and obviously HOF QBs.
I think the Saints have the better running game, but not by a lot.
It's hard not to see that game coming down to the last 2-3 minutes.
How do the Rams win this game?
They get Akers rolling and get a couple of turnovers.
That's how they turn the tide.
Mike, Packers, racquetball, social media stance, The Little Drummer Boy…we gotta be brothers separated at birth.
My birth certificate says I was born in Green Bay, WI.
What does yours say?
Dubuque, IA.
If you could have one game from this season as a do-over, which would it be?
I don't understand how that's a relevant question when the Packers have the No.
1 seed.
Winning another regular-season game would not have changed anything at this point.
Tampa Bay still would have made the playoffs if the Packers had beaten them.
How do I get a job like yours?
What'd you go to school for?
I majored in English and Spanish as an undergrad at Lawrence U. and then got a Masters in journalism from Northwestern.
While I would like both on the field often, who do you think gets more snaps against the Rams, ﻿Rashan Gary﻿ or ﻿Preston Smith﻿?
I don't know.
I would expect both to play plenty.
Some of the decisions there will be situational.
We absolutely must not start the game like the Steelers did.
No one would want that.
It's not a good recipe for success.
I was stunned to see that the Rams defense allowed just 281 yards per game.
They haven't allowed 200+ yards passing in a game since November.
This defense is formidable, even without turnovers.
How can the Packers offense be different?
It has to stay balanced.
You've got three different running backs to stay fresh in the backfield.
Keep them honest against the run, which can keep Rodgers in rhythm.
Then you pick a spot when you want to take a shot, max protect, deep drop, and see if something's there.
Who is the X-factor against the Rams on offense?
Defense?
For some reason I've got a hunch about Lazard.
No idea why.
Defensively, I'll pick ﻿Darnell Savage﻿.
I really don't expect the cold (especially the D) to bother the Rams.
Snowing especially with an inch or two on the ground would be a different story.
Any chance that's gonna happen Saturday?
Haven't heard anything to that effect.
Yet.
Do you agree Pack has better QB, better running backs and better O-line?
Doesn't that really tilt the field towards GB this weekend?
I take nothing away from Akers in the RB matchup, but I like the Packers' depth in the backfield better.
The Packers are favored for a reason.
They have to do what they do best.
But this is the NFL.
It's a funny-shaped ball that can take funny bounces.
You have to bring your A game, and I think the Packers will.
The weather forecast for Saturday afternoon doesn't appear to be too daunting, does it?
30 degrees is manageable even for a warm weather team.
Yeah, it doesn't appear it's going to be as cold as it could be in mid-January around here.
How does Tonyan match up against the Rams LBs?
I hear a bunch about Donald and Ramsey, but not so much from the LB core.
That's a great question, and I'm not familiar enough with LA's LBs to give you a good answer.
A lot of opposing offenses have to keep a TE in to block against that front, I know that.
Is it Saturday yet?
Getting there.
Hey Mike, do you see A.J.
Dillon taking on a bigger role here in the post season the way James Starks did in '10?
No.
Starks took over a backfield that did not have a feature runner.
The Packers have Jones and Williams.
If Dillon gets in and gets the hot hand, then who knows, but Jones is still the No.
1 back in this offense.
Mike, do you load up against the run and dare Goff to beat you with his arm?
I like our chances.
All I've seen when I watch the Rams his how efficient their passing offense is when they're running play-action, and how it can be rather ordinary in a straight drop-back game.
That's why I keep saying Akers is the key.
With all the talk about the Rams defense vs the Packers Offense.
Where do you see the Packers having an advantage when their defense is on the field?
I think the Packers can pressure the QB, but they have to stop the run and get them into those pass-rushing situations.
I know the Packers won following their playoff bye last year.
The last two years however they lost their regular season matchup following the bye, including this year's blowout in Tampa.
Any cause for concern in that regard?
The playoffs are always different from the regular season.
Everyone remembers the Giants game nine years ago after the 15-1 regular season, but that's the only time the Packers have lost at home after a playoff bye.
Do you think there is any chance we get to keep Jones and Williams for next year?
I really love both of them...
So does LaFleur, but we'll just have to see.
It doesn't seem realistic to me, but no one is worried about that now.
It's about the games in front of them.
I see this as a low scoring game that will be decided in the fourth quarter.
I hope we get the ball last!
I think the Packers are hoping it's not a low-scoring game, but I know what you mean.
You have to be prepared to go 60 minutes (maybe more) in the playoffs, and that goes for players and fans.
It should be a good one.
With that I'm going to sign off folks.
Thanks for all the questions today.
Take care, talk again next week.
Best, Mike

Among 108 WRs, Allen Lazard ranks as the highest graded (85.8) run blocker since 2019.
 #GoPackGo pic.twitter.com/qSxgUOrM8g
— PFF GB Packers (@PFF_Packers) April 1, 2021
No wide receiver has been better as a run blocker over the last two seasons than Allen Lazard of the Green Bay Packers.
According to Pro Football Focus, Lazard has graded out as the top run-blocking receiver in the NFL among 108 qualifying players at the position since 2019.
Last season, Lazard ranked sixth in run-blocking grade among receivers with at least 100 run-blocking snaps.
He was the No.
1 receiver in run-blocking grade on zone run snaps.
The Packers have asked Lazard to block on 351 running plays over the last two seasons.
He has been tasked with blocking cornerbacks, safeties and even linebackers and edge rushers depending on the playcall.
Coach Matt LaFleur values run blocking in his receivers, and Lazard – a tight end-sized receiver at 6-5 and 227 pounds – has embraced the role.
In fact, LaFleur once called Lazard his “enforcer” in the run game.
“He’s a complete receiver.
You can see it in the running game.
He’s kind of our enforcer.
Defensive backs know where he is at all times because he’s going to try and punish you,” LaFleur said last season.
An undrafted free agent claimed by the Packers off the Jaguars practice squad late in the 2018 season, Lazard has turned himself into an indispensable player for LaFleur in his offense.
He can operate out wide and in the slot, and his ability to block from a variety of angles and formations keeps the Packers’ run game diverse and unpredictable.
Including the playoffs, Lazard caught 40 passes for 609 yards and four touchdowns over 12 total games and 592 total snaps last season.

Free agent offensive lineman Lane Taylor visited his second team since the start of the new league year.
According to the league's transaction wire, Taylor – a starter for the Green Bay Packers to open the 2020 season – visited the Houston Texans on Monday.
Taylor visited the San Francisco 49ers last month.
Both teams likely want to check in on his recovery from the ACL injury he suffered in Week 1 of last year.
Taylor took a pay cut and returned to the Packers in 2020, and a strong summer earned him the starting job at right guard.
He was lost...
Daniel Jeremiah's latest mock draft for NFL.com has the Green Bay Packers getting help for the interior of the offensive line in the first round.
Jeremiah sent Alabama offensive lineman Landon Dickerson to the Packers at No.
29 overall.
From Jeremiah: "Dickerson is the best pure interior offensive linemen available.
I thought he might fall out of the first round after his ACL injury, but it appears his recovery is going smoothly.
He can step in following the departure of Corey Linsley."
Dickerson is Jeremiah's No.
40 overall prospect in the draft class, mostly due to injuries.
He suffered a torn...
The first episode of Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers hosting "Jeopardy!"
aired Monday.
The three-time MVP has nine more episodes airing over the next two weeks.
How did Rodgers do during his opening appearance?
It's time to go to the tape to evaluate the performance.
Here's a light-hearted breakdown of Rodgers' first episode as guest host (note: spoilers ahead):
– Solid intro.
Looks confident, ready for the moment.
Possibly too much swaying back and forth.
He might be fighting some nerves, and that's just fine.
– Terrific job reading the opening categories.

GREEN BAY – Free agency is off and running in the NFL.
Here's the latest as it relates to the Packers:
DB Will Redmond
Details: Re-signed with Packers, April 2.
Instant analysis: While serving as the primary backup to starting safeties Adrian Amos and Darnell Savage, Redmond also has been one of the Packers' top contributors on special teams over the past three seasons.
His 238 special-team snaps in 2020 were third on the team behind Oren Burks (335) and Ty Summers (327).
Redmond played in 13 games with one start last season, logging 24 tackles (18 solo), two quarterback hits, one pass defensed and four special teams tackles.
TE Marcedes Lewis
Details: Re-signed with Packers, March 30
Instant Analysis: Lewis will be back for a 16th NFL season and fourth in Green Bay, as he hinted late in the 2020 campaign.
He's a respected veteran who's become a mentor to the Packers' young stable of tight ends as well as a locker-room leader whose voice is heard whenever he speaks.
QB Aaron Rodgers has called him the best blocking tight end of this generation, and while his pass-catching numbers have been modest over the last three years (28 catches, 302 yards), the "Big Dog" did have three TD receptions in 2020.
Green Bay's coaches have repeatedly said his value to the team cannot be overstated.
DL Tyler Lancaster
Details: Re-signed with Packers, March 30
Instant Analysis: Lancaster, who joined the Packers as an undrafted rookie in 2018, did not receive a restricted free agent tender following his third season but agreed to return at a lower salary than the tender offer.
The run-stuffer from Northwestern has played in 43 games with 18 starts over his three seasons, working mostly as a rotational lineman on early downs.
His 23 total tackles last season ranked third among the Packers' interior defensive linemen, behind Kenny Clark and Dean Lowry.
RB Aaron Jones
Details: Re-signed with Packers, March 26.
Instant analysis: By retaining Aaron Jones﻿, the Packers keep one of their biggest offensive playmakers in the fold.
Coming off his first Pro Bowl season in 2020, Jones and Pro Football Hall of Famer Jim Brown are the only two players in league history to post 3,000-plus rushing yards (3,364) and 35-plus rushing TDs (37) with an average of 5.00-plus yards per carry (5.17) in their first four seasons in the NFL.
In 2021, Jones will look to become the first Green Bay running back to register three consecutive 1,000-yard rushing seasons since Ahman Green (2002-04).
CB Kevin King
Details: Re-signed with Packers, March 26
Instant analysis: King's return positions the Packers to return their top three cornerbacks and starting safety tandem from a secondary that ranked seventh in pass defense in 2020.
The 6-foot-3 cornerback started all 11 regular-season games he played in this past season, finishing with 57 tackles (second most of his career), five passes defensed, a QB hit, a forced fumble and a fumble recovery.
LS Joe Fortunato
Details: Signed with Packers, March 24
Instant analysis: Fortunato (6-4, 240) has spent time with the Indianapolis Colts (2017) and Dallas Cowboys (2020) after seeing action in 46 games for Delaware from 2012-15.
He served as the snapper on punts for four seasons with the Blue Hens and the snapper on placements for his final two years.
He's slated to compete with fourth-year veteran Hunter Bradley for the Packers' snapping job this summer.
QB Tim Boyle
Details: Signed with Detroit, March 22
Instant analysis: The laser show is staying in the NFC North.
Shortly after the Matthew Stafford-Jared Goff trade was made official on Wednesday, the Lions announced the signing of Boyle.
The 6-foot-4, 232-pound quarterback heads to Detroit after serving as Aaron Rodgers' primary backup for the past two seasons.
A popular fixture in the locker room, Boyle impressed on the field during his three summers in Green Bay.
In eight preseason games, the former undrafted free agent completed 60-of-110 passes for 650 yards, nine touchdowns and two interceptions for a 91.2 passer rating.
The Packers did not tender Boyle a contract as a restricted free agent, opening the door for 2020 first-round pick Jordan Love to serve as Rodgers' primary backup this season.
C Corey Linsley
Details: Signed with the Los Angeles Chargers, March 19
Instant analysis: While Corey Linsley's move to LA should result in the Packers receiving high compensatory pick a year from now, his departure creates a void in Green Bay's offensive line.
The All-Pro center started all 99 regular-season games in which he played since entering the league as a fifth-round pick in 2014.
Pro Bowl guard Elgton Jenkins and fourth-year veteran Lucas Patrick have some experience at center.
Jenkins started there for two seasons at Mississippi State prior to stepping in for an injured Linsley this past December for three spot starts.
RB Jamaal Williams
Details: Signed with Detroit, March 19
Instant analysis: The former fourth-round pick was a tough, versatile, and reliable fixture in the Packers' backfield for four seasons, touching the ball 659 times (including postseason) without a fumble.
Jamaal Williams owns the second-longest streak among active running backs with 500 consecutive carries without a fumble, trailing only Phillip Lindsay (534).
Now, he'll get an opportunity at seizing a featured role in Detroit.
Meanwhile, the Packers will press forward with Jones and 2020 second-round pick AJ Dillon as their featured backfield combination.
Dillon missed five games due to a bout with COVID-19, but shined during a 124-yard, two-touchdown performance against Tennessee in Week 16.
DL Montravius Adams
Details: Signed with New England, March 19
Instant Analysis: Adams flashed the potential that made him a third-round pick out of Auburn in 2017 but persistent injuries prevented the 6-foot-4, 304-pound defensive lineman from establishing a consistent role.
Adams played 595 defensive snaps over 45 regular-season games, finishing his time in Green Bay with 44 tackles, 1½ sacks, one forced fumble, one fumble recovery and three passes defensed.
The Packers likely will be in the market for defensive linemen this offseason, with Kenny Clark, Dean Lowry and Kingsley Keke the only veterans currently on the roster at the position.
Restricted tenders
Players who received a one-year tender (first round, second round and right of first refusal), which allows Green Bay to match any free-agent contract the player would sign or receive draft-pick compensation corresponding to the first two tenders.
There is no compensation for the lowest tender.
TE Robert Tonyan
CB Chandon Sullivan
Exclusive rights tenders
Players with fewer than three accrued NFL seasons who can be retained with a one-year tender at the league minimum.
LB Randy Ramsey
The skinny: Signed tender, March 18
Analysis: The 6-foot-3, 236-pound pass-rusher saw action in 12 games for the Packers in 2020.
Ramsey played just 75 defensive snaps but was a featured contributor on the Packers' special-team units, playing 204 snaps.
His nine coverage tackles were third-most on Green Bay's special teams.
WR Allen Lazard
WR Malik Taylor
T Yosh Nijman
The Packers' remaining free agents
Unrestricted free agents (UFA) with expiring contracts count towards the compensatory draft-pick equation if they sign elsewhere.
G Lane Taylor (UFA)
DL Damon Harrison (UFA)
RB Tyler Ervin (UFA)
WR Tavon Austin (UFA)
DL Billy Winn (UFA)
T Jared Veldheer (UFA)
LB James Burgess (UFA)

GREEN BAY – Prior to the start of Sunday's NFC Championship Game, Aaron Rodgers pulled aside Marquez Valdes-Scantling with a message.
"I told him before the game, 'I was going to need some plays,'" Rodgers recalled.
"'I was going to need at least two big ones.'
He made many, many, many plays for us."
The Packers' third-year receiver came through for his quarterback and his team when they needed him most, catching four passes for a game-high 115 yards, including a 50-yard touchdown, against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
While Green Bay came up on the short end of a 31-26 outcome, Valdes-Scantling provided a badly needed spark for the offense at several critical points of Sunday's game.
His 50-yard touchdown catch down the sideline, which came in single coverage against Carlton Davis, got the Packers on the board after a slow start.
Valdes-Scantling's other three catches also contributed to drives that produced points, whether it was his 12-yard slant on second-and-10 in the second quarter or his 24-yard catch down the middle of the field that got the offense going after a lost fumble on the opening possession of the second half.
"All of us in this locker room think highly of Marquez," tight end ﻿Robert Tonyan﻿ said.
"(He) made the plays when they needed to be (made).
(Even) when Marquez isn't getting the ball, he puts it into the run game and is blocking people from the beginning to the end of the whistle.
"MVS is a fighter and there's no surprise that we just keep going back at him."
It was the type of strong finish the Packers believed Valdes-Scantling could have after the 6-foot-4 receiver worked his way through a rough patch in the middle of the season that included a lost fumble in overtime of a Week 11 loss to Indianapolis.
Rodgers, Head Coach Matt LaFleur and the rest of the offense reiterated their confidence in Valdes-Scantling, who caught 10 passes for 275 yards and two touchdowns over the final three games of the 2020 season.
"I'm just really proud of him," Rodgers said.
"He's had such an interesting year.
I think it's been a good year of growth for him as a person.
That's what I'm most excited about for him as a friend."
With his 115 yards, Valdes-Scantling became the first Packers player to register 100-plus receiving yards in a playoff game on four or fewer catches since Antonio Freeman (4-107) at San Francisco on Jan. 11, 1998.
Moving parts: The Packers had to make two big changes in the second half on both sides of the ball with running back ﻿Aaron Jones﻿ (chest) and linebacker ﻿Krys Barnes﻿ (thumb) leaving with injuries.
Jones' injury came on the third play of the second half when Jordan Whitehead forced a fumble after a crosser.
﻿Jamaal Williams﻿ and ﻿AJ Dillon﻿ finished the game in the backfield, combining for 58 total yards on 11 second-half touches.
Second-year linebacker ﻿Ty Summers﻿ replaced Barnes as the Mike linebacker in the second half.
Barnes, the defense's second-leading tackler, came into the game with a club on his left hand due to the fractured thumb he suffered last week against the Los Angeles Rams.
Defensive lineman ﻿Tyler Lancaster﻿ briefly exited with an ankle injury but returned.
More history for Adams: ﻿Davante Adams﻿ posted nine receptions, giving him 63 in his career in the postseason as he moved into the No.
1 spot in team history ahead of WR Jordy Nelson (54).
With nine receptions, Adams became only the second player in NFL history to register nine-plus catches in three consecutive postseason games, joining Patriots WR Julian Edelman.
With the 63 catches, Adams has recorded the second-most receptions in NFL history by a player in his first 10 postseason games behind only WR Wes Welker (75).
Lambeau Field hosted the NFC Championship Game between the Green Bay Packers and Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday, Jan. 24, 2021.
Tough ending: From navigating the COVID-19 pandemic to overcoming injuries, the Packers battled through a lot to punch their ticket back to the NFC title game.
That's what made the sudden ending that much more difficult to reconcile.
"I truly believe this locker room loves each other," guard ﻿Lucas Patrick﻿ said.
"Through thick and thin, through the ups and downs of this whole season, and look at everything that's happened outside of our locker room, from pandemic to social issues to God knows what.
"We became closer, even closer than we were last year.
When a team breaks it down on 'Family!'
I felt that this year.
It wasn't just a saying.
We truly had each other's backs.
That's what makes it tough.
It's hard to re-create that type of environment anywhere.
This team loves each other."

packers.com senior writer
Mike, finish the following sentence: ﻿Aaron Rodgers﻿ wins MVP if he...
Gets to around 45 TD passes, doesn't throw any more picks, leads the league in passer rating, and runs the sked from here for 13-3.
Kenny Stills cleared waivers.
I though several teams would be interested including the Packers.
What do they know that I don't?
I think his contract was an issue.
Clearing waives now wipes out his deal.
Mike, what do you think of the ﻿Tavon Austin﻿ signing?
I assume he will mostly be used on special teams, but what can we expect if anything from him on offense?
Popular question.
Hard to say, but it didn't take long last year for LaFleur to work ﻿Tyler Ervin﻿ into certain offensive packages, so I'd expect him to take a similar approach with Austin.
He can certainly jump in right away on special teams, too, just like Ervin did last December.
Has the team made any adjustments based on the experience of the Denver QB situation?
LaFleur said he was considering some options.
But it's important to remember if the Denver QBs had just worn their masks in meetings, as they're required to, they wouldn't have been put on the reserve list.
Hi Mike!
Watching the all 22 film, I have noticed in the past that the Chicago QB10 will stare down his primary receiver.
He appeared to do that on both interceptions on Sunday.
﻿Darnell Savage﻿ seemed to take off after reading the QB eyes in both cases.
Would a player respond to a direct question about reading the QB eyes in an interview after the game or would that be kept to themselves?
I don't know.
Most players aren't going to reveal much, especially when they might see the same QB again.
But it was pretty obvious when the Bears called a deep shot that Trubisky wasn't reading anything, he was throwing deep no matter what.
Is the best play we've seen from Rodgers since 2014?
I would say so, yes.
The run the table stretch in '16 was awfully good, too, but this is a longer period.
I saw Austin play some in college, he was impressive and he put up some impressive combine numbers but I was still surprised he went to 10.
Do you the high draft status and the expectations that went with it have hurt his NFL career?
It was out of the norm for a 5-8 skill player to be drafted in the top 10, that's for sure.
But that was so long ago, none of it matters now.
It's all about what he can do with the new opportunity in front of him.
I'm sure he's plenty motivated.
With COVID protocols, how long before Austin can play?
He had to clear all that before the signing was official, so he's good to go as far as I know.
Is ﻿Allen Lazard﻿ good to go on Sunday?
He indicated after the game on social media he's fine.
We'll see what the injury report says later today and as the week goes along.
It seems like I've seen a lot ﻿Za'Darius Smith﻿ crashing down to rush the passer this year and breaking contain on running plays.
Is this something you've noticed too?
I'm not trying to nitpick such a great player.
Pettine was asked about that last week.
There are times Z crashes down and someone else has containment responsibilities, and those aren't held up.
Other times it is his responsibility and he has to be more mindful.

I assume Rodger's has still not revealed what he saw in old footage that has improved his play?
Not specifically, but he's reiterated it's more about the comfort level with the offense and the changes LaFleur and the coaches made in the offseason to streamline some things in the scheme.
That's been the greater benefit regardless.
What is the protocol for players that have tested positive for COVID to return to the active roster?
Also for the ones that have been out for awhile are they given time to practice with the team before they count against the 53?
I confess I don't know all the details there, and LaFleur hasn't discussed any of that publicly.
I don't think there's a roster exemption for those players to practice and not be on the 53.
They have to be activated to practice, I believe.
It seems like they did not blitz much last week against Chicago, is that correct?
With Philly's O line issues seems like they might not need to do much of that this week to get consistent pressure?
Pettine hasn't blitzed a ton this year, I think mostly because when he has sent a fifth rusher, there's often minimal impact on the QB.
If blitzing doesn't help with the pressure, you're just making yourself one guy short in coverage.
The Eagles' O-line has been banged up and shuffling around all year.
Wentz leads the league in sacks.
You'd like to get home with four and then throw a surprise here or there.
Can we anticipate ﻿Anthony Rush﻿ seeing much in the way of game time action on Sunday?
Really hard to say.
I'm sure the coaches are going to try to find out what he can offer and find a role, albeit a very limited one at least at first.
At this point in the season, which Packers will be selected to the Pro Bowl?
Which Packers 'should' be selected to the Pro Bowl?
And to go a step further, which Packers should be selected for All-Pro?
I'll probably forget someone here, but Rodgers, ﻿Davante Adams﻿, ﻿David Bakhtiari﻿, ﻿Jaire Alexander﻿ and Z. Smith probably have the best Pro Bowl chances.
I think Jenkins should be in the mix, too, but sometimes there's a lag in the recognition with younger players.
Hi Mike - It was great to see the run game do so well, providing a more balanced offense than we've seen in the past few weeks.
Were you surprised that ﻿Aaron Jones﻿ + ﻿Jamaal Williams﻿ switched off each series & shared equal carries?
It seemed to work, but I still feel that Aaron Jones is the better RB, averaging more yards per carry.
Do you see MLF using this same approach in upcoming games?
(I may or may not be asking this because Aaron Jones is on my fantasy team) ;)
I think Aaron Jones is still the No.
1 guy, but last week Williams got a lot more carries late when the Packers had a big lead and the Bears knew they were going to run the ball.
It really just depends on how the game goes.
Is it a given that ﻿Elgton Jenkins﻿ will be at center, or could they slide ﻿Lucas Patrick﻿ in there and revamp the line that way?
Patrick would be an option, but based on what they've done the last two weeks I expect Jenkins to be at center while ﻿Corey Linsley﻿ is out.
Absolutely convinced I have to be patient in waiting for young receivers to develop in tandem with AR.
He has such high expectations but when they "get it" the results are amazing.
﻿Equanimeous St. Brown﻿ is beginning to show flashes.
St. Brown's contributions in the Chicago game are a good sign moving forward.
Nothing wrong with finding more options on offense.
Elgton Jenkins ability to play all 5 line position is pretty unique and he seems capable of playing them all at a pro-bowl level.
Is that assessment to far over the top?
That might be a bit much.
He's an interior lineman, and I think he can play either guard spot or center at a really high level.
The fact that he can slide out to tackle and hold his own is no small feat, but I can't say I've seen enough to say he could play tackle as well as ﻿David Bakhtiari﻿ or Bulaga or someone like that.

I thought the Packers would get more pressure against the Bears.
Their O-line is not a strength.
If Wentz isn't running for his life Sunday can we admit that we have a pass rush problem?
We'll see.
The Packers definitely need to be able to put the heat on Wentz straight up against that line.
Has there been any talks with Aaron Jones so far and do you believe they'll get a deal done?
I've heard no updates but my gut says they're going to try to bring Jones back.
How big was that ﻿Preston Smith﻿ scope and score for him?
Seems he has been frustrated this year...can this get him going?
I mentioned in the live blog during the game that Preston needed something to smile about.
He finally got that during this frustrating year.
His sack was a good power move on third down, too.
Let's see how he builds on it.
In the Zoom press conferences, how do they decide the order of who asks the questions?
Would you like having that structure even when they go back to live?
Would seem to help to avoid questioners stepping over each other.
The members of the team's communication staff who run the calls, usually Sarah or Jackson, call on the reporters to ask their questions.
There's no set order, but they do a great job managing it in my opinion.
The process has its plusses and minuses.
It is nice not to have people talking over one another to get a question in, but it's also harder to get a follow-up question in on a particular topic when there are so many others who have yet to be called on.
There's no perfect way, but I'll admit overall it's nicer and easier to just see the players in person to talk to them.
Have you been able to watch ﻿Rashan Gary﻿ individually during games or after?
Has he expanded from his one bull rush move?
Gary is not a one-move rusher from what I've seen.
He's got pretty active hands.
I think his bull rush is his best move, but he's got the quickness to do other things, too.
Do you think there's any chance the Eagles play Jalen Hurts at QB for any of the game on Sunday?
He took a couple of snaps on Monday night, and I would expect more of the same.
It might be difficult on a short week to expand his workload too much, but you never know.
With big leads, our defense seems to go into management mode rather than seeking to dominate for four quarters.
I'm curious if you think this saves wear and tear in a long season and if there isn't a danger of it leading to a less committed mentality?
I don't question the players' commitment at all.
The players are human, they know where things stand in a game, and nobody is interested in risking a major injury.
It is a long season and playing fire-breathing defense when the score is 41-10 or 41-17 just isn't realistic to me.
Some good running teams coming up, including Tennessee down the road, do you see the defense going to more of a base with two ILBs?
It will depend on matchups for sure.
The Packers use a lot of different fronts that aren't straight base against the run.
Sometimes it's 3 DL, 2 OLB, 1 ILB; or 2 DL, 2 OLB, 2 ILB.
Straight base with only 4 DBs is the best way to stop the run, but it invites play-action, and a guy like Tannehill in Tennessee has thrived against that with so much attention on Henry.
Every opponent is different.

I understand the playoffs have expanded from 6-7 teams per conference and only one team gets a bye.
I would like to know if they kept the formula for matchups after the wildcard round which had the highest seed play the lowest seed or if they changed it to top seed plays winner of the 4 vs. 5 game more like March Madness.
Go Pack Go!
My understanding is the 1 seed, which gets the bye, still plays the lowest remaining seed after the wild-card round and the rest of the matchups are arranged accordingly ... 2, if still alive, gets the next lowest, etc.
Miles Sanders is far from the same player as a Kamara or Cook, but can do damage in a similar fashion.
Do you agree it starts by stopping him and forcing Wentz to pass more for our defense to be successful?
Absolutely.
If that Philly O-line gets things going for Sanders, that'll make everything defensively more difficult and offensively easier for Wentz.
﻿Jaire Alexander﻿ is already one of the best CBs in the league but I believe in order to be considered the best or one of the best ever he needs to improve his ball skills and regularly complete more interceptions.
Has he ever talked about working on his catching and ball tracking skills?
Jugs machine etc.
?
He works on it all the time, believe me.
It's not for a lack of effort.
He's covering really well and hence doesn't get a lot of chances thrown his way.
I think some of the opportunities he does get, he gets so excited it almost works against him.
How many Pittsburgh and Baltimore fans do you think are suddenly feeling ill and asking to get off work early today?
Such a weird time and day to have an NFL game; just doesn't feel right
The league is doing everything it can to avoid a Week 18 of the regular season.
I don't even know what kind of team Baltimore is going to be able to put out there they've had so many positive tests.
The Packers beat the Bears handily.
Unfortunately many of us Packer fans have seen leads slip away over the years.
Was one stout defensive stand too much to ask for?
On to the Eagles.
Glad to have the game pushed back a bit as that will give us time to get home from deer camp.
GB's defense played an outstanding third quarter -- two punts and one pick -- which allowed the lead to go from 27-10 to 41-10.
This Eagles game has been slated for 325 all year.
Next week at Detroit was pushed back to 325.
Isn't it interesting that Trevor Davis turned out to be a great draft pick.
He got us ﻿Jon Runyan﻿.
I hadn't traced all of that, but that's an interesting way to look at it.
Runyan has filled in nicely and now gets to settle in for a couple weeks.
HI Mike: I was reading Inbox today and there was a picture of Rogers and one later of Jones, wishing them both a happy birthday.
Is that true?
Keith
Yes, the two Aarons share the same birthday, and it's today.
With that, I'm going to sign off, folks.
Thanks for logging on today and we'll talk again next week.
Stay safe and take care.
Best, Mike

The Brown County Children's Charity Golf Classic and the Green Bay Packers announced their goal of raising $1 million to establish an endowment with Northeast Wisconsin Technical College for at-risk youth living in the local community, beginning with this year's outing scheduled for September 2021.
"There is a significant need to address equity access to higher education in Brown County and our partners are taking necessary steps to increase opportunities for youth," said Brown County Executive Troy Streckenbach.
"Through Brown County's human services divisions, we witness that children who struggle often go down the wrong path.
We hope to provide an avenue to quality, post-secondary education to enrich their lives while improving diversity, equity and inclusion efforts."
Beginning in 2004 as part of a condition in a lease agreement with the Packers' use of Nitschke Field, the Brown County Children's Charity Golf Classic is a fundraising event underwritten, planned and operated by Brown County with meaningful participation from the Packers to benefit children's services as determined by Brown County.
This partnership will also seek another sponsor to help strengthen the push to establish this endowment.
"As a long-standing partner of this program, the Packers are proud to see this event establish a goal that will result in life-changing paths for our community's young adults.
I encourage our local businesses to become a partner with Brown County and the Packers and join us in supporting this crucial cause to serve our community's next generation," said Packers President/CEO Mark Murphy.
In 2012, the Brown County Children's Charity Golf Classic partnered with the NWTC Educational Foundation to provide need-based scholarships for students who may not have had the opportunity to attend college.
This 10th anniversary is underscored with the NWTC Educational Foundation mission to make college possible, no matter the financial situation.
"We are honored to be a continued partner of Brown County Golf Classic and the Green Bay Packers," says Dr. Jeff Rafn, NWTC President.
"Northeast Wisconsin Technical College Educational Foundation is dedicated to removing barriers that so many individuals experience when they pursue a degree and ensuring each student, regardless of their financial situation, will have access to education."
To date, more than $400,000 has been raised by the Brown County Children's Charity Golf Classic for NWTC.
Scholarships are awarded to senior students in Brown County who are nominated by a career coach, who are at risk, homeless, or in foster care.

Titletown Development LLC, the real estate development arm of the Green Bay Packers, today announced plans for Breakthrough, a transportation management and technology provider in Green Bay, to locate its new headquarters, the Breakthrough Collaboration Hub, in Titletown Office in partnership with the Green Bay Packers.
"As our vision for Titletown continues to be realized, Breakthrough is an ideal company to join us," said Mark Murphy, Packers president and CEO.
"From its leading-edge business approach to its talented people and creative culture, Breakthrough is an asset to our region and the Packers are very excited to welcome their team to Titletown.
"The energy and enthusiasm in Titletown have been tremendous.
This is another great step in the development as we add to the 'live, work, play and create' amenities that have been key to the plan.
We know it is crucial for our community to be able to attract and retain highly skilled employees and we're pleased we've been able to establish a desired location for innovation, including the presence of TitletownTech, that helped play a role in Breakthrough's next step in the Greater Green Bay area."
The office building, located along Lombardi Avenue and Marlee Lane in the west end of Titletown, is a seven-story tower, including a first-floor lobby level, five levels of office space and a top floor of meeting and event space for tenant use.
It consists of approximately 150,000 square feet of Class A, premium office space that likely will have several hundred workers when fully utilized.
"Breakthrough is thrilled to call Titletown home," said Doug Mueller, Breakthrough president and CEO.
"We have spent many years giving thought to the Breakthrough Collaboration Hub, ensuring we were building a space for our team to grow and build our culture, our business, and how we deliver distinguished value to our clients.
Titletown is the perfect place for our organization to do just that."
Construction is underway and Breakthrough plans to move into the space in late fall 2021.
Breakthrough will occupy the fifth and much of the fourth floor of the office tower.
The space will provide a flexible work environment for Breakthrough's highly innovative and collaborative team, numbering more than 100.
The location in Titletown will also provide a unique, elevated experience for the company's valued clients when they meet in Green Bay to further their transportation strategies.
Wisconsin-based Commercial Horizons is an investor in the development and the designer of the office building.
In addition to Titletown Office, another approximately 100,000 square feet of future development is envisioned.
Concepts being considered include retail, health and wellness, food and beverage, and entertainment.
Titletown Development LLC
Titletown Development LLC, the development arm of the Green Bay Packers, is building upon the success of Lambeau Field's major redevelopment in 2003 and recent expansion and renovations with its work on Titletown.
The 45-acre development maximizes its great location just west of the iconic stadium to attract additional visitors to the area, spur further regional economic growth, offer new amenities to residents and complement Greater Green Bay's draw as an excellent location to live, work, play and create.
Phase one of Titletown included the four-diamond hotel Lodge Kohler, Hinterland Restaurant and Brewery, Bellin Health Titletown Sports Medicine & Orthopedics, TitletownTech, The Turn and Associated Bank.
Phase two is set to include approximately 220 residences and a five-story office building, as well as additional development that may feature retail, food and beverage and entertainment.

The first objective was the NFC North.
Check.
Then the focus shifted to getting the No.
1 seed.
Check again.
But as the Packers chalked off another goal with Sunday's 35-16 win over the Bears at Soldier Field, earning the NFC's only first-round bye as well as home-field advantage, the celebration afterward carried the same undertone.
This is progress, but it's not the destination.
Not even close.
"The job is not done," safety ﻿Adrian Amos﻿ said.
"We put ourselves in this situation to conquer the ultimate goal.
This is just the next step in that journey."
To be sure, there was some celebrating going on postgame.
Getting to rest up over the first weekend of the playoffs is worth smiling about, and it even prompted Head Coach Matt LaFleur to start dancing in the locker room.
Most of the dancing is usually left to running back ﻿Jamaal Williams﻿, but LaFleur promised him he'd "bust out a few moves" if the Packers did what they needed to Sunday.
Rhythm, or lack thereof, aside, ﻿Aaron Rodgers﻿ referred to getting to "recharge" for a playoff run in which the Packers can reach the Super Bowl without leaving the friendly confines of Lambeau Field.
While home-field advantage in this pandemic season isn't what it normally would be, since no fans are in the stands, the Packers believe it still will matter because of the Green Bay weather that some of their potential playoff opponents – like the Rams, Buccaneers or Saints – won't be accustomed to.
"It's a world of difference," receiver Davante Adams said.
"People play different, people act different, they talk different, everything (is different) coming through Lambeau.
It is what it is.
You can come in and try to bark and be barefoot pregame, shirt off and do whatever you want to do, but at the end of the day it's a beast playing in that snow.
It's a beast playing in that weather.
"It's not going to be easy but it gives us a tremendous amount of confidence knowing we're at home.
And from what I've seen in the past, it's taken that confidence away from our opponents."
The Packers have four possible matchups for the divisional round – Tampa Bay, Los Angeles, Washington, or Chicago again – depending on how next weekend's wild-card games unfold.
They'll find out the specific day and time of their game late next Sunday.
Green Bay would not face New Orleans or Seattle until a possible NFC title game.
Soldier Field hosted a Week 17 matchup between the Green Bay Packers and Chicago Bears on Sunday, Jan. 3, 2021.
The Packers will enter the postseason on a six-game winning streak, and while they did not take advantage of the No.
1 seed and bye the last time they had it in 2011, Rodgers isn't concerned about this team getting stagnant with the time off.
The Packers won their first playoff game after a bye in both 2014 and last year.
The difference this year is another divisional-round win will set up the conference title game at home.
"I'm not worried about any rust or anything," Rodgers said.
"We've been really solid all season in situational football and we were again today on third down and red zone.
So I like our chances going forward."
LaFleur said he's giving the players a couple of days off and then they'll get back to work during the bye week.
Banged-up players can hopefully get healthy, and the offensive line can further settle into its new alignment without left tackle ﻿David Bakhtiari﻿ following his season-ending knee injury.
Keeping the coronavirus out of the locker room remains of utmost importance as well.
That threat doesn't disappear just because the regular season has concluded.
LaFleur is stressing discipline and responsibility from all involved.
It'll play a part as the Packers try to get back to a Super Bowl for the first time in a decade.
"We will celebrate this and we're happy that the road to Tampa goes through Lambeau," LaFleur said, referring to the site of Super Bowl LV.
"But we also understand that there's a lot in front of us."
That message didn't even need to get through, because it's already been there.
"It's a big thing around the locker room that this is not … this wasn't our only goal," Amos said.
"This was just the start of it."

GREEN BAY – A lot went wrong, and then the Packers had a lot of chances to make it right.
In the end they gave themselves too much to overcome and didn't cash in when the opportunities were there, suffering a crushing 31-26 loss to the Buccaneers in the NFC title game on Sunday at Lambeau Field.
"I'm kind of at a loss for words right now," Head Coach Matt LaFleur said after a second straight season ended on the cusp of the Super Bowl, this one at home.
"It hurts right now.
I hurt for everybody involved."
The list of regrets is long.
A nightmare sequence at the end of the first half and start of the second.
Then after a rally, multiple drives in the fourth quarter down one score that came up empty, followed by questions about a fourth-down decision and a defensive penalty that sealed the Packers' fate.
"This one does sting," LaFleur continued.
"It's going to take a long time to get over this one."
The events that put the Packers in a huge hole were totally avoidable.
Trailing 14-10 late in the first half, ﻿Aaron Rodgers﻿ was intercepted by Sean Murphy-Bunting near midfield with 28 seconds left.
After a fourth-down conversion kept Tampa Bay's offense on the field with less than 10 seconds to go, cornerback ﻿Kevin King﻿ was burned in man coverage by speedy receiver Scotty Miller for a 39-yard touchdown with one second on the clock.
The Packers then started the third quarter with a fumble by running back ﻿Aaron Jones﻿ on a third-down crossing route, and Bucs linebacker Devin White scooped it up and returned it to the Green Bay 8-yard line.
Jones was injured and exited the game, and one play later, Tom Brady's TD pass to tight end Cameron Brate had Tampa Bay ahead, 28-10.
"You just can't do that stuff," LaFleur said of what amounted to two touchdowns allowed in less than 75 seconds of game clock, and putting the blame on the coaching staff for the wrong defensive coverage call at the end of the first half.
"That's inexcusable.
That should not have happened.
"That was a tough pill to swallow.
That was about as bad of a sequence as you could have in a critical game, obviously."
The Packers battled back with touchdowns on their next two drives, sandwiched around an Adrian Amos interception, to make it 28-23 heading into the fourth quarter.
But when Jaire Alexander got another interception of Brady to thwart a Tampa Bay scoring drive, the offense went three-and-out, allowing Shaq Barrett's third sack of Rodgers.
A second Alexander pick preceded another three-and-out, with the Bucs' fifth sack of the game.
Two opportunities lost.
"We had some chances," Rodgers said.
"Had the ball there with all the momentum.
Just kind of needed one first down to get going, and didn't get it, which is disappointing."
A Buccaneers field goal made it 31-23 and then Green Bay's offense finally got moving again on a 29-yard completion to Marquez Valdes-Scantling﻿, who four catches for 115 yards, including a 50-yard TD in the first half.
But then came another stall at the worst possible time, with three incomplete passes on first-and-goal from the 8.
With 2:09 left and the Packers possessing all three timeouts, LaFleur surprised many by deciding to kick the field goal and see if the defense could get the ball back.
"I was looking at we essentially had four timeouts with the two-minute warning," explained LaFleur, who also said going nowhere from the 8 on three plays, and needing the two-point conversion with the touchdown, factored into the decision.
"Anytime something doesn't work out, do you regret it?
Sure."
Rodgers (33-of-48, 346 yards, three TDs, one INT, 101.6 rating) said he had called the third-down play, which resulted in a scramble and incomplete pass, and suggested he might have called something different had he known LaFleur wasn't going to go for it.
"That wasn't my decision," Rodgers said.
"I understand the thinking above two minutes with all our timeouts, but it wasn't my decision."
Lambeau Field hosted the NFC Championship Game between the Green Bay Packers and Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday, Jan. 24, 2021.
It might have worked and given Rodgers one more chance needing only a touchdown (and no PAT) to win had the officials continued to hold their flags on their hips.
But cornerback ﻿Kevin King﻿, who had allowed two TDs including the deep one to Miller, was called for defensive pass interference on a third-down incomplete pass with a little over a minute and a half left.
It was the only penalty for holding or interference called in the defensive secondary all game despite a lot of physical play against receivers.
"I think it was a bad call.
I think there were a few opportunities for some plays down the field for us that weren't called," said Rodgers, referring in part to his interception at the end of the first half when it appeared Murphy-Bunting grabbed Allen Lazard before the throw.
"Just surprised that call, in that situation, was made.
We get the ball back with probably 1:35 and a timeout with a chance to win the game, go to the Super Bowl.
Didn't look like it was even catchable, so yeah, I think it was a bad call."
Added LaFleur, who was plenty upset with the officials at several moments throughout the game: "I was pretty surprised (at the call) just based on how the game went.
They were letting us play.
The bottom line is the official made the call.
That's what it is and we have to live with that.
There's no use crying about it now or complaining about it now.
What's done is done."
Unfortunately, so is the Packers' season, after the Buccaneers drained the rest of the clock to earn their first trip to the Super Bowl in 18 years, and in Brady's first year in Tampa Bay.
Brady (20-of-36, 180 yards, three TDs, three INTs, 73.8 rating) will appear in his 10th Super Bowl.
Meanwhile the Packers' Super Bowl drought is now 10 full seasons, which have seen four NFC Championship losses in that span.
LaFleur credited his players for their resilience and the comeback in a tough situation, but that doesn't make the result any less painful.
"That's a special locker room," he said.
"I love those guys, love everything they bring.
I really hurt for those guys, and hurt for our fans."

The Green Bay Packers have re-signed S ﻿Will Redmond﻿.
General Manager Brian Gutekunst announced the transaction Friday.
Redmond, a 5-foot-11, 186-pound sixth-year player, has played in 31 regular-season games with five starts over the last three seasons for the Packers while appearing in all four postseason contests.
He tied for the team lead and set a career high with nine special-teams tackles in 2019.
Redmond was originally selected by the San Francisco 49ers in the third round (No.
68 overall) of the 2016 NFL Draft out of Mississippi State.
He spent his entire rookie season on injured reserve with a knee injury and the first eight games of 2017 with an ankle injury.
Redmond was released by the 49ers on Oct. 31, 2017, and signed by the Kansas City Chiefs to the practice squad on Nov. 9, 2017, where he spent the rest of the season.
He was released by the Chiefs on Sept. 1, 2018.

packers.com senior writer
Hey everybody, welcome to NFC Championship week.
Thanks for logging on.
I see some questions coming in already, so keep them coming and let's get right to it.
As I was watching the game I noticed that I didn't see ﻿Darnell Savage﻿.
Was he injured during the game?
His stats are pretty low.
No, he wasn't injured.
The Rams didn't challenge the Packers much down the field.
Goff's 21 completions only gained 174 yards.
It was mostly dink and dunk, which takes the safeties out of play.
Any word on if Vita Bra will be active for Tampa Bay?
How would that affect the rushing game plan?
I assume you mean Vita Vea.
We may not know if he'll be activated until the end of the week.
He hasn't played in three months.
It'll be interesting to see, if he does play, how much of a workload he can handle after only 3 days of practice.
Hi Mike.
We can talk game plans til we're blue in the face, I don't expect Pettine to drastically change his scheme for one game.. but if there's a game to bump and press I believe it's this one.
Brady will kill zones, isn't a mobile threat, and the weather could make the game a little slower.
Challenge those receivers and let ﻿Rashan Gary﻿, ﻿Za'Darius Smith﻿, ﻿Kenny Clark﻿, etc get to work up front.
If I know Pettine, he isn't going to have his guys run one coverage all game.
He's always going to mix it up.
He prefers that against any QB, HOF or not, so they can't get an easy reads on what you're doing.
The question is will he lean more toward man or zone in the back end.
That could depend on the personnel packages the Bucs use.
Who's the X factor?
Great question.
I'm still trying to decide.
What's the big difference you see in this matchup between week 6 and now?
Mine is ﻿Davante Adams﻿ was in his first game back in week 6 and that seemed to affect his timing with ﻿Aaron Rodgers﻿.
That may have been part of it.
Also, Clark was back for the first time from his injury and wasn't the same.
The Packers will have ﻿Allen Lazard﻿ and ﻿Kevin King﻿, who didn't play in Week 6, as well.
Hi Mike.
Do you see Mike Pettine playing more zone?
I imagine ﻿Chandon Sullivan﻿ having a hard time covering Antonio Brown, Godwin or whoever they play against him.
We'll just have to see.
It all depends where the safeties are deployed as well.
Help over the top?
Run support?
The Packers have to stop the run first.
Hey Mike!
What's the latest on ﻿AJ Dillon﻿?
Will he be available to truck over White this week?
Haven't heard anything on Dillon.
The Packers practice today around 1:30 so I'll see if he's out there.
Good morning Mike.
Thanks for the chat.
Another great WYMM.
It's turned into my favorite piece on the web, Thanks.
Thanks for watching/reading it.
That was some really fun offensive film to watch.
Mike, did that jumping out of your suite seat include a fist pump?
No, I had to get my fingers right back on the keyboard for the live blog.
Do you think LaFleur speaks with McVay and Shanahan this week to get any insight on how to attack Tampa's D?
It's great to have some great offensive minds as friends that you can reach out to.
I don't know, and if he does, I doubt he'd tell us.
I've seen the stats that indicate Brady's struggles when under pressure.
What's the scoop on Tampa Bay's offensive line?
Will we be able to get in there with a four-man front, or are they too good to beat one-on-one?
I thought Tampa's offensive line was what won the two playoff games against the Washington and New Orleans fronts.
That unit is playing as well as the Packers' unit right now.
How much film study does the team put towards the week 6 matchup versus what Tampa has done in the playoffs?
That previous matchup seems so long ago.
It was a long time ago, and that's up to the coaches.
LaFleur said there are things to learn from the game, but nobody is going to dwell on it.
Sounds like a good approach to me.
I know the risk in putting a starter as a returner on Special Teams but given the stakes, is it possible we see someone like ﻿Jaire Alexander﻿ or another starter back there returning at some point in the game to try to energize the return units?
I wouldn't rule anything out, but that would be a pretty major change for this late in the game.
That in itself, no matter who it is, comes with risks, too.
Mike - at first the crowd was supposed to be 6,000.
I have since heard 7, then 8 and now 9,000 fans.
What was the official count and is there and limit on the number of fans from the NFL?
The official paid attendance Saturday was around 7,400 but the Packers announced there were a total of around 8,400 in the stands.
You guys are the most talked about team right now in the NFL.
In an interview with Davante Adams, he stated that at this point, the only team that can beat you guys are yourselves.
What are some things that you think need to be fixed before the game on Friday?
I don't think it's a matter of fixing anything.
It's a matter of finding ways to stay efficient on offense and continue to take away the big plays on defense.
That and protect the ball has been a good formula for this team.
In watching the Packers first game against Tampa, my one overriding thought was how their MLBs wrecked the Packers game plan.
How does MLF and the offensive coaches game plan to neutralize White and David?
I have no idea.
That's why they get paid the big bucks and I'm sitting here.
My x-factor is Kevin King.
With the way Jaire has been playing I think Brady is going to look to who King is matched up with early and often.
Very good possibility.
How can the Packers defense generate more pressure to disrupt the Tampa passing game this time around?
Pressure on the interior is how you disrupt Brady.
It's how he lost the two Super Bowls to the Giants.
Easier said than done, but getting pressure from the inside will make a huge difference, and that falls on Clark and a lot of times Za'Darius, who moves inside when Gary comes in on the edge.
Are we about to find out how much Tom's blood has thinned since moving to Tampa?
I suppose, but it's not going to be brutally cold or anything.
Colder than last week by 10 degrees or so, but I don't think it's going to be some kind of shock to Brady's system.
The larger question is how their perimeter players handle the ball in these elements.
Where is the weak spot on this Tampa defense (if any) and where can the Packers really attack them?
They like to press and get their hands on receivers.
They really challenged the Saints WRs at the line, in part I think because they weren't worried about Brees being able to beat them deep.
Handle that physical play on the outside and some opportunities will be there.
Who do like in the AFC?
I said when the playoffs started I thought Buffalo had the best chance to knock off the Chiefs, so I'm not surprised it's these two.
It's hard for me to see KC losing, though, if Mahomes plays.
But I don't think the Bills winning would be a huge shock*.
*
If Dillon can't go, does that remove the 2-RB package (with ﻿Aaron Jones﻿ motioning out) from the playbook?
No.
They could still do that with ﻿Jamaal Williams﻿ and Jones.
It just puts a larger snap load on both guys, but there's no holding back in a game like this.
I heard the cardboard signs made good noisemakers.
Anything else they might use?
I'd say stick with what was working.
Hi Mike, I was rather surprised that we didn't see a whole lot of ﻿Damon Harrison﻿ on the field Saturday.
Considering we knew how badly the Rams needed to run the ball I thought for sure we would see more of him.
With the way that the Bucs have been rushing this postseason, do you think there is any chance we see more of him this weekend?
It all depends on the personnel the opponent uses.
If they're still lining up three wide, it's hard to load up too heavy against the run.
You still have to have guys who can get after the passer if it's not a run.
If they come out with two TEs or other run-heavy looks, that changes the thought process.
Hello Mike, my 2 cents is better blocking on punt returns may help produce better field position.
Just a thought.
Just no penalties or turnovers.
That's all I care about at this point.
What's your gut telling you about this game based on your experience and understanding and expertise on NFL especially Packers?
It's a toss-up.
It really is.
Both teams are playing extremely well.
Both teams have HOF QBs.
The Packers are at home, which you'll take anytime.
But I don't think either team comes into this game with a decided advantage in any way.
The cold shouldn't affect Brady or Gronk as they have played many games in less than ideal weather but do you think it'll have an impact on the rest of the roster?
That's what we have to find out.
Jones, Godwin, Fournette, Evans ... guys like that, one wrong hit or one bounce off the hands from the cold could mean a turnover.
Interior pressure is also how the Broncos beat Brady twice in the AFC championship...
Bingo.
In year two we've seen the full extent of MLFs playbook and the devastating impact it can have on an opponent.
My question is have we seen all of it or do you expect to see some New looks Sunday?
I don't know if we'll see anything brand new, but the coaches are always developing variations off of things they already run.
That's a constant process.
Congrats to Philip Rivers on retirement.
I know you don't have time to do research but didn't it feel like he always had a great game whenever he played the Packers?
Yeah, his numbers against GB were pretty crazy.
But the Packers did beat him a couple of times even when he lit it up.
Will ﻿Kingsley Keke﻿ be available this week??
We could use all the pressure we can muster.
Again, won't know until practice this afternoon where things stand with him.
Hopefully he's been recovering OK.
Jamaal Williams didn't have a lot of touches against the Rams but I thought it was his best performance running the football.
Your thoughts?
I loved how Williams ran the ball against the Rams.
He was just charging hard and protecting the ball every time he touched it.
His effort was outstanding.
Plenty of yards after contact.
Same with Jones with some of his spins.
The D has to run to the ball and gang tackle.
This seems to be more prevalent lately.
The defense is playing much better than it did earlier in the year.
There's no question about that.
It always starts with getting more hats to the ball and not asking guys to make one-on-one tackles in open space.
Last week you correctly predicted Lazard as the player to watch... thoughts this week… you are hot!
That's why I said before I'm still thinking about it.
You guys are putting all kinds of pressure on me here.
Could it simply be Rogers vs. Brady?
It could be which of them makes the fewest mistakes.
But I also think it's as much about the running games for both teams, because that's what sets up the QBs to be at their best.
Hi Mike, what say you?
Hold Fournette to less than 60 yards rush and 60 yards receiving and Pack win?
It's not just Fournette.
Jones is a tough runner, too.
The Packers can't let the Bucs' ground game set the tempo.
Aaron Rodgers is playing super.
Last game vs Bucs he looked like a deer in the headlights.
How will that be different?
As I mentioned in Inbox today, it's about finding rhythm and timing on offense.
The 10-0 lead down in Tampa in Week 6 was gained with all off-schedule, improv stuff.
Rodgers had no rhythm from the start and he knew it wouldn't last playing the whole game that way against that defense.
The legacy implications on this game and playoff run are massive for Rodgers.
Beating TB in the NFC Championship Game would be legendary and something Packer fans would never forget.
I think Brady has had plenty of success, this is Rodgers time.
Let's hope so.
Hi Mike, do you think this is a tougher defense for GB to face since so much of the offense is dependent on the run and LA didn't really have Donald at 100%?
It's a defense built very differently.
The Rams had the best D-lineman in the league and the best corner, with Donald and Ramsey, and one of them wasn't full strength.
This defense is built around the inside LBs, the best duo in the league.
The Packers have to find a way to get them blocked in the running game to get some consistent yards on the ground.
It's not going to be easy.
Will ﻿Robert Tonyan﻿ be a key?
He's always going to get his number called a handful of times every game.
And so far he's always been ready.
In the game between the New Orleans Saints and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, a lot of people in the NFL community thought that the New Orleans Saints were going to move on.
Of course, this was not the case.
Is there anything that concerns your team reviewing this?
I think the Saints were going to win if Jared Cook doesn't fumble on the third-down conversion.
Saints were up 7, and that conversion put them across midfield and they were going to go up two scores.
It changed the game and the Saints never found anything on offense the rest of the way.
Hi Mike, what do your eyes tell you about how each of these teams played in the last month?
I think it is evenly matched across the board, what do you think?
As I said, I think both teams are playing really well.
Both got hot at the right time, which is what it takes.
Do we match up better with the Bills or Chiefs?
I couldn't care less.
I think the availability of AJ Dillon could be key.
His 255 pound punishing runs especially in the 2nd half in 26 degree weather will wear any D down.
Thoughts?
Williams runs with as much power as Dillon from what I've seen, but the more options you have, the better.
Before last season Gute made four very big FA signings.
I was very high on ﻿Adrian Amos﻿ and the Smith's at the time.
I must admit not so much on the ﻿Billy Turner﻿ signing.
I was Wrong!
Major contribution at three line spots have made him well worth the price.
Thought he was outstanding at LT Sunday.
From what you've seen this year which of the three spots is he best at?
I think his best spot is RT if I had to pick one, but you're right, he's been invaluable with what he's provided in terms of versatility and high-level play.
Really important piece to this team.
Do you know that status of Antonio Brown?
I heard he was injured last week at NO?
They're saying he's day to day with a knee injury.
An MRI revealed nothing serious.
Any word on players possibly coming back in the playoffs from IR?
No word.
The best definition I know for irony is "reality laughing at naivety".
Ergo for something to be ironic there must be a naive view at the root.
There is nothing particularly naive about the Bills or Packers losing their Week 6 games, nor in imagining different results this weekend.
So coincidence, not irony.
Thanks.
Mike, with the six rings and all the GOAT talk, do you think Rodgers feels like he has something to prove?
It has nothing to do with who's on the other side.
Rodgers knows full well what a second Super Bowl would mean to his legacy, and it's been driving him for a long time now.
Do the Bucs have any corners who can match up with our tight ends?
If Tampa has to commit at least one of White/David to coverage, that could go a long way.
Another interesting matchup to watch.
They could use their LBs or a safety.
We'll see.
I'm calling at least 2 interceptions and 2 sacks for our defense; the players will feed off the crowd and Tampa's snap count should become more predictable with the noise factor.
Scary Gary will have at least 5 pressures.
That's bold, calling Brady with two picks.
One might be enough to turn the game.
The x-factor answer is always ﻿Marcedes Lewis﻿.
You got it, Big Dog.
Mike, you had feeling about Lazard last week and it was spot on.
Who do you think will have big game this week?
You guys just won't stop with this.
I'm going to have to sign off and sit and ponder this between now and our shoot for Final Thoughts at the end of the week.
Thanks for all the questions everybody.
Take care and enjoy the game.
Best, Mike

Packers team historian
Gordon from Jupiter, FL
Several years ago, I read that in 1978 GM/HC Bart Starr went to the board of directors and said he wished to give up his dual position and continue to serve as head coach only.
He recommended that the team hire Ron Wolf, then employed by Tampa Bay, as the new general manager.
The board, according to the article, rejected Starr's offer and he continued to serve in both positions.
In "My Life in Football," Starr's abbreviated autobiography, he says nothing about this incident.
But he is openly apologetic about the two dreadful draft mistakes he made in 1979 and 1981: passing on Joe Montana for defensive tackle Charles Johnson and choosing quarterback Rich Campbell instead of safety Ronnie Lott.
If it is true that Wolf could have been Packer GM in 1978, I can't imagine him passing on these stars.
Can you?
P.S.
– I have been a Packer season ticket holder since 1957.
Let's set the record straight first, it's not a true story.
I don't remember when and where, but I've heard that story, too.
I think it was circulated by others – not Starr – who prefer to blame the Packers' executive committee for the failures of the 1970s and 1980s.
Actually, Wolf told me someone close to Starr told him that story.
But they had their facts wrong, as far as where Wolf was working at the time, etc., so he knew it wasn't true.
Players from the 1980s, for example, like to blame former team president Robert Parins for the loss of 1980 No.
1 draft pick Bruce Clark.
Some have made Parins the scapegoat for just about everything, but they haven't gotten the basic facts right, either.
Parins didn't become chief executive officer of the Packers until October 1981 and didn't become president until May 1982.
That was two years after Clark signed with Toronto of the Canadian Football League.
Plus, Bob Harlan, who handled the negotiations with Clark, says he never even discussed the talks with Dominic Olejniczak, who was the president at the time.
Harlan said the only person he consulted with was Starr, who was still the general manager and called the shots on player contracts.
It doesn't surprise me that Starr never mentioned the Wolf story in his autobiography and, instead, took the blame himself for those ill-advised draft-day decisions.
In my 36 years as a sportswriter, I might have interviewed Starr more than anybody else and it wasn't his nature to pass the buck.
Years later, Starr talked about how he regretted not hiring a strong personnel man to handle personnel matters.
But I'm assuming when he wrote his autobiography, he remembered how strongly he opposed the idea when he was running the Packers' football operation.
When the board of directors voted to strip him of his general manager duties after the 1980 season, he fiercely resisted it.
Blindsided by the decision, that was not his finest hour.
He ripped the board members, who were his bosses; initially refused to appear at a press conference; and snapped at Lee Remmel at one point to throw The Milwaukee Journal's Dave Begel out of the room.
While Starr and I had a sometimes adversarial, but mostly respectful relationship, he granted me and Press-Gazette sports editor Tony Walter a personal interview only minutes after the announcement.
I asked most of the questions and one was if he would insist on retaining his authority over the draft and personnel matters, despite the board's decision?
"Absolutely.
I wouldn't give it up for a minute," he answered.
When he was then asked point blank if he would work for an experienced football general manager, he answered, "Nope, I wouldn't even think of it."
That vote was taken on Dec. 27, 1980, less than a week after the Packers had finished the season 5-10-1, their fifth losing season in Starr's six years as coach.
The board meeting lasted nearly three hours and might have been the most contentious in club history other than the 1949 meeting over Curly Lambeau's status.
The executive committee had recommended that Starr be retained in both roles, but there was a block on the 45-member board who wanted to fire Starr that day and his opponents all but took over the meeting.
I've been told close to 20 board members spoke up and few, if any, expressed support for Starr.
In fact, when it appeared the votes might be there to fire Starr, Parins, one of the two newest members of the executive committee and also recently elected vice president, proposed the compromise to keep Starr as coach and replace him as GM.
Parins' recommendation passed, but the battle didn't end there.
Starr continued the fight to maintain his control over player personnel and, less than two weeks later, the executive committee all but reversed the board's decision.
It took away Starr's GM title, but not the duties.
Instead, it decided to give both Harlan and Tom Miller the title of assistant to the president, and allow Starr to retain his authority over all football decisions.
With Starr resisting the change, some of the most qualified candidates told various media outlets that they had no interest in the job.
But I don't believe Wolf's name was ever mentioned as a possible candidate.
Nor was there any talk about him becoming GM of the Packers in 1978.
During the timeframe you mentioned, Wolf resigned his post with the Buccaneers, where he was promised the authority of a general manager, but had lost a bitter power struggle with then coach John McKay and was headed back to the Oakland Raiders.
He certainly wasn't looking to get into another situation where he'd have to fight daily battles with a head coach.
What I learned only after I read our corporate minutes from the 1920s into the 1980s – all executive committee, board and shareholder meetings – before embarking on our upcoming definitive history of the Packers was that Starr also insisted on being given the general manager title and complete control over the organization when he was hired in 1975.
Following Dan Devine's departure, Olejniczak learned through an informal poll of board members that they preferred a separation of powers over football and non-football matters with separate administrators in charge of each.
In response, the executive committee followed up by drafting a memorandum of understanding where it outlined a plan to hire a football manager, who would double as coach, and an administrator who would be in charge of the team's business affairs.
Harlan appeared to be the consensus choice for the administrative post, but Starr wanted Harlan to report to him not the president or executive committee.
Thus, Starr was basically given the same authority that Vince Lombardi said eight years earlier was too much for one person.
By the way, smart decision on your part to buy season tickets in 1957.
The Packers were hoping to sell out their new 32,000-seat stadium on a season-ticket basis and engaged in an aggressive drive to do so, but fell roughly 8,000 tickets short.
Four years later, when they started winning under Lombardi, the stadium was sold out on a season-ticket basis for the first time and many fans have lived to regret that they didn't buy tickets earlier.
You also got a good bargain out of the purchase.
When what is now Lambeau Field opened in 1957, the highest-priced season-ticket package cost $14.25 and the cheapest, $6.75.
Unless, of course, you qualified for the kids' section, like I did.
Tickets there cost $2.25.
Yes, that's $2.25 total for three games in Green Bay.
The single-game price was 75 cents.

I'm wondering why Bart Starr wasn't named one of the top 10 QBs of the first 100 years?
9-1 in playoff games, five-time NFL champion, highest playoff QB rating even though three of those games (1962, '65 and '67) were in pretty crappy conditions.
All he did was show up and win the big games, arguably better than anyone else or at least in the top three with Otto Graham and Tom Brady.
Isn't that how we gauge QBs?
He did better in the playoffs than any of those who were named to the top 10.
Why would he have been excluded?
Regular-season stats?
I've tried to reach out to several of those on the committee but have not received a response.
Would love your perspective.
Thanks!
First, let me say this: When I was deeply honored to receive the Bart & Cherry Starr Award two years ago, I devoted most of my speech to all that Starr had overcome to accomplish what you've spelled out: From his three years at Alabama, where he started as a sophomore and then basically lost his job; to entering the NFL as a 17th-round draft pick; to three years of being either an understudy or sharing the starting duties in Green Bay; and, finally, two more years where Vince Lombardi waffled over his starting quarterback.
It took Starr four years to win his first NFL start and then he became the first quarterback to win five NFL titles.
That's why the point of emphasis in my speech at the Packers Hall of Fame banquet was this: "For any kid or young adult wishing their pursuits or careers were advancing faster than they actually are and getting down or impatient about it, nothing could be more instructive or motivating than Bart Starr's pursuit of his dream.
He epitomized perseverance like few others in his chosen field."
Maybe I should have said, "Like few others in our lifetime."
It's truly one of the great inspirational stories in sports.
I also spend a good share of Chapter 6, the longest in our definitive history, addressing what seemed like a complicated relationship with Lombardi.
Take these two quotes, for example, by Lombardi in the last year of his life.
1) "Sonny Jurgensen is a great quarterback.
He may be the best this league has ever seen.
He is the best (passer) I have ever seen."
2) "Johnny Unitas has been a great, great, great quarterback.
But Starr did the winning in the 1960s.
And that is the object – to win."
Lombardi makes the same point you did, on one hand; and then praises Jurgensen as maybe the greatest quarterback in the history of the game, even though he hadn't guided Washington to a winning season in the five years before Lombardi took over.
Before Dallas and Washington met for the first time in 1969 – a matchup of old antagonists, Tom Landry vs. Lombardi, as it was billed – Landry said Lombardi was running the ball more than Washington had done in the past, but also was throwing the ball like he hadn't in Green Bay.
"When you have a quarterback as great as Sonny Jurgensen, it's only natural that you keep throwing that square-out pattern, which is so hard to stop," Landry said before the game.
You've raised an interesting debate.
And I'm only guessing, but I can almost hear the discussion in that selection meeting now.
On one hand, there were the five world championships as they were called back then.
On the other hand, I'm guessing some credited that more to a great coach and a great supporting cast, including 12 Pro Football Hall of Famers as teammates, far more than Brady's going to have, for example.
On one hand, Starr had his best games in the biggest games during the Packers' three-peat, winning MVP honors in the first two Super Bowls and leading maybe the most memorable drive in pro football history in the 1967 NFL championship, now remembered as the Ice Bowl.
On the other hand, he was named the NFL's all-pro quarterback only once in his career and that was in his 1966 MVP season, and was selected to the Pro Bowl by the head coaches in his conference only once during the three-peat.
John Brodie, Fran Tarkenton and Roman Gabriel were picked ahead of him in 1965 and 1967.
On one hand, he's the only quarterback ever to win five championships in a single decade.
On the other hand, the role of the quarterback was important when he played, but nothing like the be-all and end-all position it is today.
The other quarterbacks who won NFL titles in the 1960s were Hall of Famer Norm Van Brocklin, who both Lombardi and Starr admitted was the difference in the 1960 title game when the Eagles beat the Packers; Billy Wade of the Bears in 1963; Frank Ryan of the Browns in 1964; Earl Morrall of the Baltimore Colts in 1968; and Joe Kapp of the Vikings in 1969.
In turn, when Lombardi came to Green Bay, he built his offense around the left halfback and one play, his particular version of the power sweep.
On one hand, Starr still holds the NFL postseason record for best passer rating at 104.8, as you noted.
On the other hand, he had some pretty modest stats in some of the Packers' championship seasons: A 12 to 9 touchdown-to-interception ratio in 1962, 16 to 9 in 1965 and 9 to 17 in 1967.
On one hand, I think it's totally unfair to refer to him as simply a game manager because he was much more than that when he played.
On the other hand, many teammates and both opposing coaches and players have said his greatest strength was his preparation and play-calling.
With Starr, there were no wasted plays, his backup, Zeke Bratkowski, once told me.
Bratkowski coached in the NFL for 26 years, into the 1990s, and he said when coaches started calling the plays, quarterbacks would often run something right into the teeth of the defense.
Starr, on the other hand, called his own plays in the huddle and sometimes changed out of them more than 20 times a game at the line of scrimmage, Bratkowski added.
Play-calling was as important as any aspect of a quarterback's job when Starr played.
Which raises this point now that quarterbacks almost never call their own plays unless they call an audible.
One of my criteria when I was on the Pro Football Hall of Fame selection committee was whether a player would have been a star at any time, for any team, in any system.
That was my pitch when I had to make the presentation for James Lofton.
Obviously, because of the way the game has changed, it was fair for the committee members to ask: What kind of quarterback would Starr be today?
That would have been an unfair question when he was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, but not in this case when the job of the committee was to compare quarterbacks from all eras.
Here's one other point along the same lines from those championship seasons, 1965-67: Bratkowski was 8-1 in games, including 1-0 in the playoffs, when he started in place of Starr or replaced him with the score tied or the Packers trailing by no more than seven points.
The bottom line here is: What's the definition of greatness?
And everybody has their own.
You've placed a premium on winning championships and made several good points.
My feeling is and I wrote this once before, championships should be only one of many considerations in judging quarterbacks.
John Elway won two Super Bowls at ages 37 and 38, but none in his first 14 seasons.
Would you argue he was a better quarterback in his last two years than he was in his prime?
Trent Dilfer and Nick Foles won Super Bowls.
Are they better than Dan Marino?
Is Eli Manning as good as Peyton Manning because both won two Super Bowls?
If the 10 quarterbacks on the NFL's Centennial team had been picked based solely on championships, I believe these would have been the selections with their number of titles listed: 1) Brady, 7 (only 6 at the time of the vote); 2) Starr, 5; 3 (tie) Red Dunn (he was the last QB in Curly Lambeau's Notre Dame Box to line up and play much like a T-formation QB), Sid Luckman, Terry Bradshaw, Joe Montana, 4; 7 (tie) Otto Graham, Johnny Unitas, Troy Aikman, 3; 10) Bobby Layne, 3, but loses on a tiebreaker because he was injured and didn't play in the 1957 NFL championship.
The debate here could go on forever.
But what I don't understand is why Packers fans seemed to have been upset only over Starr's omission?
The two most decorated Packers from the 1960s, aside from those who made the team, were Herb Adderley and Willie Wood.
They received numerous plaudits when they were playing for being the best at their positions on championship teams that won with defense more than anything.
Yet they didn't make it either.
Or what about Paul Hornung?
Lombardi called him his "greatest player."
Ron Wolf, who was on the committee, and I have talked about that.
Hornung's rushing and return stats might not compare to Gale Sayers' numbers, but without Hornung, the Packers might not have won two of their first three titles under Lombardi.
Sayers, who played in 68 games compared to Hornung's 104, never played on a championship team, yet he made the all-time 100.
Personally, I think Sayers is the greatest breakaway back that I've ever seen.
At the same time, Lombardi is the only coach in NFL history to win five NFL titles in a decade and he considered Hornung not only his best player, but also "the best all-around back ever to play football."

I wrote sports in Green Bay in the late 1970s.
The rumor was that Chuck Lane, PR director for the Packers at the time, lobbied in a strong way to have Bart Starr as the head coach.
Anything to that story?
I believe if anyone had an inside scoop on something like that, it would have been you.
If true, how much influence would Lane have had with the decision-makers at the time?
Chuck Lane left the Packers as public relations director following the 1974 season to take a job working for Starr as his marketing director.
Lane could no longer tolerate working for Dan Devine.
After serving as quarterbacks coach in 1972 under Devine, Starr had resigned after that season and spent two years as a television analyst for CBS.
You're right, it was generally understood that Starr had hired Lane to orchestrate a campaign against Devine and to promote Starr as a candidate to replace him.
I don't know that the plan was necessarily aimed at the executive committee, as much as to build a public groundswell so the committee would have little choice other than to name Starr once Devine departed.
When the 1974 season ended, the Packers' executive committee was ready to fire Devine when he accepted the head coaching post at Notre Dame.
The Packers, in turn, interviewed two candidates for their opening: Starr and Dave Hanner.
And fans got their wish: Starr was named coach.
When I asked Lane if he was hired for the purposes you mentioned, he told me, "I had a great deal to do with getting Bart Starr his job.
He knows it, I know it and the executive committee knows it."

John from Green Bay
I recently purchased a 1950 Packers stock certificate signed in 1959 by John Torinus and Dominic Olejniczak as secretary and president.
Who was the secretary of the executive committee in 1959?
The stock was issued in 1950.
Would there have been any stock issued in 1959?
A few years ago, I spent a month or more going through our corporate records of the 1923, 1935 and 1950 stock sales.
Actually, I found the records for the 1923 sale to be more complete than those for the 1935 sale, partly because buyers in the latter sale could choose a stock certificate or advertising space in the Packers' game programs for their $25, and it was difficult to determine at times which choice businesses made.
As for the 1950 sale, there were complete records, including two sets of receipt books and typewritten lists of the buyers.
There were books of pocket-sized receipts and also large ledgers where the sales were listed.
That was in addition to master lists of shareholders.
However, in digging through the records, there were discrepancies with what previously had been published in the Green Bay Press-Gazette during the stock drive, in several Packers history books, other publications and even our own media guide for a number of years.
What I found was that there were still 468 shares of outstanding stock from the 1935 sale that some writers and perhaps Packers officials had included to boost the total amount of money raised during the 1950 drive.
Those 468 shares were worth $11,700.
I also found that people pledged to buy stock during the door-to-door drives in 1950 and then didn't follow up and pay for it.
That's why for years, it was reported that the Packers raised more than $118,000 in the 1950 sale – I've even seen a number as high as $125,000 – when, in fact, they raised a little more than $104,000 that year.
However, in response to your question, no deadline was set for the sale.
Thus, an additional 50 shareholders were added to the rolls between 1951 and 1959, which mathematically would have raised an additional $1,250.
But, for example, Vince Lombardi received a single share on Oct. 23, 1959.
What I don't know is if he had to pay $25 for it or if the Packers simply gifted it to him?
Ditto for newly elected board members who hadn't previously purchased shares.
That's why our media guide now states the amount collected in the 1950 sale was $104,137.50, which was the amount raised prior to the Jan. 22, 1951, shareholders meeting, according to the minutes of that meeting.
(Yes, nine people were allowed to purchase a half-share at $12.50.)
For transparency's sake, our former shareholders services manager, had previously researched the same corporate records that I did and arrived at a figure that was $2,550 more than mine, although with a slightly different timeframe, April 10, 1950 through Dec. 19, 1950, which might have been viewed at the time as the unofficial end of the drive.
But that was a substantial enough number to raise doubt in my mind about the accuracy of my total.
Thus, I conducted a second search of the more than 1,600 receipts, and I believe I found an explanation for all but $50 of the difference.
On April 15, 1950, Northern Paper Mills was listed on receipt No.
184 for purchasing 100 shares of stock.
On July 9, 1950, the Sullivan-Wallen American Legion Post was credited on receipt No.
1501 for owning 100 shares of stock.
But there was a notation on the Sullivan-Wallen receipt that it was actually a transfer of the 100 shares purchased by Northern Paper Mills on April 15.
In essence, one sale was recorded twice in the receipt books.
(Northern still owned $500 worth of stock from the 1935 sale.)
In the end, after taking that into account, two searches by different people arrived at figures within $50 of each other.
That's why I feel confident the $104,137.50 figure is accurate.
John Torinus was elected secretary-treasurer of the Packers on March 7, 1955, and continued to serve as secretary until his death in October 1985.
Fred Trowbridge replaced him as treasurer in 1959.

What was the date of the first Monday Night Football game in Green Bay?
Oct. 1, 1979.
The Packers beat New England, 27-14.
ABC started broadcasting weekly Monday night games in 1970, three years into the Packers' nearly quarter-century drought.
Thus, they weren't exactly a popular draw.
In all, the Packers played in 10 Monday night games before 1979 and only three of those were home games, all played at Milwaukee County Stadium.
The reason for not playing in Green Bay was this: The lighting at Lambeau Field was inadequate for a national, nighttime, color telecast.
Before the 1979 season, the Packers installed new lights that provided six times the illumination of the old lights.
Jon from New York City
Small corrections.
In answering a question about the 1972 Packers, you wrote: "But take nothing away from what was the only Packers team to win a division between Lombardi's last season and Mike Holmgren's fourth season."
In 1982, the Packers also won the NFC Central Division title (albeit in a strike year).
In answer to a question about the oldest teams in the NFL, you wrote: "Then again, the Packers have been based in the same city longer than any team in the NFL."
Both the Packers and the Bears have played in the same city since 1921, although the Bears were still known for that season as the Staleys.
Thanks for all your great work.
In 1982, when the strike was settled in November, part of the agreement called for dropping division standings and determining the 16 playoff berths by conference records.
Yes, the Packers had the best record (5-3-1) of the five NFC Central teams, but no division champions were recognized.
Nor were division standings kept for the remainder of the season.
Actually, the Packers played only three games against division opponents – two vs. Detroit, one vs. Minnesota – and they were 1-2.
Two games each against Chicago and Tampa Bay were cancelled.
As for your second point, I'll grant that probably most people responsible for recording the NFL's history and records, and maybe even most pro football researchers would agree with you.
They might also tell me that I'm quibbling over semantics.
But from what I've been able to determine, this is another example of revisionist history on pro football's part.
Yes, the NFL Record & Fact Book and Total Football, the NFL's official encyclopedia, list the team that won the 1921 league title as the Chicago Staleys.
As for the semantics, I wrote "based" in the same city, whereas you wrote "played" in the same city.
And I contend there is a difference.
Here's why I believe the Staleys were still Decatur's team in 1921.
They held their preseason practices there and played their first two games there – a non-league game vs. Waukegan and a league game vs. Rock Island – before playing the rest of their home schedule in Chicago.
The Rock Island game drew an estimated 4,000 fans to Staley Field in Decatur; the next week, the Staleys played the Rochester Jeffersons at Cubs Park and drew double that.
Obviously, there was more money to be made in Chicago.
However, I don't believe the league ever voted to approve a move and the Chicago Tribune, among others, continued to refer to the team as the Staleys of Decatur.
So did the Decatur newspapers.
Before the APFA's January 1922 meeting, the Decatur Review speculated that the city was about to lose its team to Chicago, but added: "While the Staleys played all their big games in the Cub Park, they were known as Decatur Staleys, a thing which did not sit so well with some of the typical Chicago Boosters."
Granted, the Staleys also practiced in Chicago once they started playing their games there.
But the Packers also practiced in Chicago for close to a month at the end of the 1921 season because their new recruits were scattered across the Midwest and there weren't enough players living in Green Bay to practice there.
This also was during a time when the fledgling league had traveling teams that didn't play games at home, but weren't stripped of their name because of it.
There were headline writers in 1921 who used "Chicago Staleys," but in almost every newspaper that I could find that year in other APFA cities, the sportswriters continued to refer to the team as the Decatur Staleys.
Here's a sampling: In September 1922, in a preview to the next football season, the Chicago Tribune wrote: "The Chicago Bears, which will be the name of the team that is made up for the greater part of the Decatur Staleys of last fall."
When the Packers played the Staleys for the first time on Nov. 27, 1921, George Whitney Calhoun covered the game for the Press-Gazette, and his lead read: "Fighting as only a Green Bay team can fight, the Packers went down to defeat at the hands of the Decatur Staleys by the score of 20-0…" When the Staleys played the Buffalo All-Americans on Dec. 4, 1921, in the game that settled the APFA race that year, the lead in the Buffalo Courier read: "The Staleys, the husky professional football team hailing from Decatur, Ill., but playing their games in Chicago…" Before the first of the two Buffalo-Staleys games in late November, the Buffalo Enquirer's headline read: "All-Americans Off for Chicago; Will Play Staleys."
But the first paragraph started: "Buffalo football fans and the members of the All-American football team living in and near Buffalo will board a special car on the Michigan Central railroad tonight at 9 o'clock and start for Chicago, where tomorrow they will take on the Decatur Staleys…" Joe Carr was president of the league and based in Columbus, Ohio.
While I don't have access to the Columbus newspapers or any of Carr's files, the Akron (Ohio) Beacon Journal, home to the third team in the APFA race that year, also referred to the eventual champions as the Decatur Staleys as late as the third week of November.
Ditto for The Dayton (Ohio) Evening Herald, home of another APFA franchise and only 70 miles from Columbus.
It stated in its Oct. 21, 1921 edition that "the Triangles will leave Saturday night for Chicago where they will play the Staleys of Decatur at Cubs Park…" I did a newspapers.com search of the "Chicago Staleys" for the year 1921 and got only 38 hits, including stories with the words "Chicago" and "Staleys," but also "Decatur."
I haven't researched this the way I would have if the subject pertained to the Packers and maybe there's a record somewhere that can prove me wrong, but it sure seems like that in 1921 (the only year that counts) almost the entire pro football world considered the Staleys to be Decatur's team.

GREEN BAY – Damon "Snacks" Harrison has played in one playoff game thus far in his nine-year NFL career, and it happened to be at Lambeau Field.
He's about to tally his second in the same location as the newest member of the Packers' defensive line, and he wasn't 50 words into his first meeting with the Green Bay media when he referred to what's in front of him as "the chance of a lifetime."
The Packers claimed the massive, 6-3, 339-pound ﻿Damon Harrison﻿ off waivers last week from Seattle.
Just a few days after arriving in Green Bay, the veteran run-stuffer was on the field in the regular-season finale at Chicago to help the Packers lock up the No.
1 seed for the NFC playoffs.
Defensive coordinator Mike Pettine is familiar with Harrison, having held the same position with the Jets back in 2012 when the undrafted rookie entered the league with New York.
Pettine is "thrilled" to have another proven, big-bodied defender to bolster the run defense – which already was on the uptick before Harrison's arrival – for the postseason charge.
He played just a dozen snaps against the Bears, and while he graded his own performance as "OK," his teammates saw something more when they reviewed the film on Wednesday.
"He was in on plays," quarterback ﻿Aaron Rodgers﻿ said.
"He was playing like we know he can play.
"I think that's the exciting thing for a veteran player I would imagine, as you see your career winding down, being able to be a part of something that legitimately can go the distance, it's special."
Harrison thought he'd found that by signing with Seattle earlier this season, an opportunity he couldn't pass up, which led him to forego a planned visit to Green Bay at that time.
The Seahawks became his fourth career team, after the Jets (2012-15), Giants ('16-18) and Lions ('18-19), and he'd only played in one postseason game in his first eight years in the league – the 2016 NFC Wild Card playoff the Giants lost to the Packers.
He'd be headed to the playoffs again had he stuck with the Seahawks, but after moving from their practice squad to the active roster and playing sparingly in six games, he wanted a chance to make more of an impact.
He asked for his release and then gave his agent a short list of teams he was interested in.
He turned down several clubs that wanted to claim him, chose Green Bay among those he preferred, and then had a whirlwind few days that culminated in wearing a new No.
98 jersey in Chicago.
"I played in this defense my rookie year and somewhat my first two years, so a lot of it is just trying to reach back in my memory bank and bring it out," he said.
"It's just trying to get a better understanding of the playbook and ways that guys play.
You're learning that on the fly, so last week was a little tough, but it was alright."
As for the famous nickname, the story he'll neither confirm nor deny is he got caught with the Jets having Rice Krispies treats in his socks at practice, and the "legend" grew from there to where his mother even calls him "Snacks."
Monikers aside, Harrison appreciates being welcomed by many of his new teammates and already has enjoyed working with and playing alongside fellow interior lineman ﻿Kenny Clark﻿.
Both Pettine and Rodgers referred to Harrison having a "presence" in the locker room as a veteran player trying to make the most of a late-career chance.
"It's great for depth, but it's also, here's a guy that's an ultimate pro," Pettine said.
"He's very conscientious."
That's why Pettine knows the subtle changes to techniques and fighting blocks from what Harrison is more accustomed to won't take long to come around.
Not quite getting those down yet is what led to Harrison's lukewarm self-evaluation of his Green Bay debut.
But the big fellow said he still loves the game and feels great physically, so he's all in for a playoff run, especially getting to watch Rodgers from the sideline rather than see him from across the line of scrimmage.
"Bringing in a veteran who's played a lot of football, there's a legitimacy to that person and that opportunity," Rodgers said.
"He mentioned after the (Bears) game, it's good to be on the right side of one of these for once.
That definitely made me smile and chuckle."

Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers told “The Pat McAfee Show” that there is no update on his contract, a focal point of speculation this offseason, and he believes nothing has changed since when the team drafted quarterback Jordan Love in the first round last April.
The Packers, despite needing salary cap room this offseason, haven’t restructured or extended Rodgers’ contract, which the NFL MVP said is “really not a story.”
“Nothing has really changed,” Rodgers said Monday.
“My future is, a lot of it is out of my control.”
Rodgers threw 48 touchdown passes and led the Packers to a 13-3 record and the No.
1 seed in the NFC last season.
He won his third NFL MVP and was the league’s first-team All-Pro quarterback.
Despite his incredible season, Rodgers still believes his future is a “beautiful mystery,” as he’s often described it over the last year.
“It’s quite uncertain which direction things are going to go,” Rodgers said.
“All I can do is play my best.
I feel like last year I did do that, and may have thrown a wrench into some timelines that may have been thought about or desired.
Ultimately, things haven’t really changed on that front.”
Rodgers, 37, has three years left on the contract he signed in 2018.
The Packers have not converted money in the contract to create salary cap space or added on years, leaving the door open for a future transition to Love, who will go into next season as Rodgers’ backup.
He said there’s no update to be had on his contract.
“There’s really not a story there,” Rodgers said.

Free agent offensive lineman Lane Taylor visited his second team since the start of the new league year.
According to the league's transaction wire, Taylor – a starter for the Green Bay Packers to open the 2020 season – visited the Houston Texans on Monday.
Taylor visited the San Francisco 49ers last month.
Both teams likely want to check in on his recovery from the ACL injury he suffered in Week 1 of last year.
Taylor took a pay cut and returned to the Packers in 2020, and a strong summer earned him the starting job at right guard.
He was lost...
Daniel Jeremiah's latest mock draft for NFL.com has the Green Bay Packers getting help for the interior of the offensive line in the first round.
Jeremiah sent Alabama offensive lineman Landon Dickerson to the Packers at No.
29 overall.
From Jeremiah: "Dickerson is the best pure interior offensive linemen available.
I thought he might fall out of the first round after his ACL injury, but it appears his recovery is going smoothly.
He can step in following the departure of Corey Linsley."
Dickerson is Jeremiah's No.
40 overall prospect in the draft class, mostly due to injuries.
He suffered a torn...
The first episode of Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers hosting "Jeopardy!"
aired Monday.
The three-time MVP has nine more episodes airing over the next two weeks.
How did Rodgers do during his opening appearance?
It's time to go to the tape to evaluate the performance.
Here's a light-hearted breakdown of Rodgers' first episode as guest host (note: spoilers ahead):
– Solid intro.
Looks confident, ready for the moment.
Possibly too much swaying back and forth.
He might be fighting some nerves, and that's just fine.
– Terrific job reading the opening categories.

Aaron Rodgers regained some control over his immediate future during the 2020 season.
The Green Bay Packers won 13 more games, Rodgers delivered his third MVP season and the team was a few uncharacteristic plays away from going to a Super Bowl.
While his contract remains a highly speculative issue, Rodgers’ future in Green Bay is once again mostly in his hands.
Of course, the Packers trading up to take Jordan Love in the first round last April forced everyone, including Rodgers, to recalibrate the timeline of his career.
He lost some control.
He admitted as much after the pick.
No team trades up in the first round to take a quarterback they don’t ever intend on playing.
Sure, the Packers always invest in quarterbacks.
But the pick was also a reflection of where the team saw the twilight of Rodgers’ career heading.
An MVP season as great as the one Rodgers just produced certainly must have forced another internal recalibration inside the walls of Lambeau Field.
This quote from Rodgers last May reverberates: “I know I can control this year and my play and my approach and my attitude.”
These variables are all within Rodgers’ control again in 2021.
And with another great season playing the game’s most important position, he’ll make it nearly impossible for the Packers to move on, even with Love waiting in the wings.
At this point, the Packers haven’t done anything to Rodgers’ contract, creating the assumption that – if left untouched – the team would likely transition to Love following the 2021 season.
But it’s an assumption without factoring in all the variables, including Love’s development and also one of the most important variables: Rodgers’ performance next season.
No one should expect Rodgers to repeat the kind of numbers he created last season, but there’s absolutely no reason to expect a significant dropoff, considering the players returning, the possibility to add help in the draft and both the scheme and play-caller.
The Packers offense lost center Corey Linsley but was mostly kept together.
The team has 10 draft picks.
And Matt LaFleur is still designing plays and calling games.
This offense, which ranked No.
1 in scoring last year, should be great again in 2021.
The New England Patriots drafted Jimmy Garoppolo but never turned to him as the starter because Tom Brady never made it possible.
The situations aren’t synonymous, but Rodgers – who is still only 37 years old – holds much of the same power.
In many ways, the 2020 season helped Rodgers begin rewriting a new final chapter.
He mastered LaFleur’s scheme, rediscovered his Jedi powers from the pocket, played a style of quarterback befitting an aging passer and didn’t get hurt or show any signs of physical regression.
He displayed, week after week, that he can distribute the ball on time, with stunning accuracy, and run LaFleur’s quarterback-friendly offense without the need for constant improvisation.
And as a result, he led the NFL in completion percentage and passer rating, took only 20 sacks and was never on the injury report.
The 2019 season was rocky on offense.
Signs of previous regression persisted, highlighting why the team invested in a quarterbacking insurance policy.
But last season should have given the Packers great confidence that Rodgers can play at a high level for many more years.
Brady just won a Super Bowl 43 years old.
Rodgers, who doesn’t turn 38 until December, is just as intelligent at quarterback as Brady but with a better arm and more overall athleticism.
His skillset should age well, especially if his legs – a focal point of his rejuvenation in 2020 – remain strong and healthy.
There’s now strong evidence to suggest Rodgers could play well into his 40s.
The Packers likely haven’t touched Rodgers’ contract because they want to keep all their options open.
In many ways, they are in an ideal situation at the position, with the league’s MVP under contract for three more seasons and a first-round pick developing behind him.
No one really knows if Love can play, but the Packers probably have more talent at quarterback than any other team in football.
Waiting – and letting all the variables play out for at least another season – has to be an attractive option to the Packers.
If Rodgers suffers an injury, reverts to an old playstyle or shows signs of physical regression in 2021, and Love takes the right developmental steps, the Packers can make the franchise-altering move and make a change at quarterback entering 2022.
But if Rodgers plays at a high level again next season, Love’s development probably won’t matter.
No team is going to take on over $17 million in dead cap to move on from an MVP-caliber player.
Like Mark Murphy said a few months back, the Packers’ decision-makers aren’t idiots, and only an idiot would send a future Hall of Fame quarterback packing after back-to-back seasons of elite-level play.
If the salary cap is a worry in 2022, and it almost certainly will be, an extension can be done next offseason to lower Rodgers’ number and provide some relief.
The work on his deal doesn’t need to happen now.
Rodgers might have concerns about being a lame-duck player, but they are mostly unfounded.
He has control.
It might not be financial control.
But it’s a type of control that works in his favor.
The play of Rodgers in 2021 will likely have more to say about his future with the Green Bay Packers than any other variable.

GREEN BAY – They were chanting "M-V-P!"
late in the fourth quarter.
They were banging their signs on Lambeau Field's metal bleachers.
They were making all the noise they could, and loving every minute of it.
"It felt like 50,000 when we ran out of the tunnel.
It really did," quarterback Aaron Rodgers said of the first actual crowd at Lambeau Field this season, officially listed as 7,439 paying customers who witnessed Saturday's 32-18 victory over the Rams in the NFC Divisional playoff.
"It was such a special moment.
I forgot how much you truly, truly miss having a crowd there."
🗣 M-V-P!🗣 M-V-P!🗣 M-V-P!🤟 @AaronRodgers12 | #GoPackGo pic.twitter.com/yfYVBrFutG
Every player who spoke to the media afterward voiced his appreciation, and concurred with Rodgers' estimate that the crowd sounded much larger than it really was.
Perspective is everything, one must suppose, after half a regular season with no fans at Lambeau and then a second half with a smattering of a few hundred each game.
The fans Saturday were dispersed throughout the stadium bowl, all the way around without any empty sections.
Some were scattered in the upper reaches of the south end zone, too.
"That definitely made a big difference," Head Coach Matt LaFleur said of what amounted to roughly 10% of Lambeau's normal capacity.
"I think our guys really fed off their energy."
The best part is they get to come back and see this special Packers team one more time, in next Sunday's NFC title game against either the Buccaneers or Saints.
For that matchup, slated to kick off at 2:05 p.m. CT, it will likely be colder than Saturday's 35 degrees, rather temperate for mid-January in Green Bay.
But the Packers will take whatever Mother Nature has in store for their first NFC Championship Game at home in 13 years.
It'll be Rodgers' first as the starting QB after four such contests on the road.
He was victorious in his first, at Chicago 10 years ago, but the Packers have lost three straight since – at Seattle, Atlanta and then San Francisco last year.
Next week, Rodgers will be playing the highest-stakes home game of his career against another future Hall of Fame QB, either Tampa Bay's Tom Brady or New Orleans' Drew Brees.
He promised to talk more about the pending showdown in the coming week.
But after Saturday's triumph, the soon-to-be three-time MVP, who has made a point to cherish various steps along this unusual 2020 journey, preferred to relish for a moment the win that's setting up the opportunity he's always wanted.
Lambeau Field hosted an NFC Divisional playoff matchup between the Green Bay Packers and Los Angeles Rams on Saturday, Jan. 16, 2021.
"Definitely a little emotional, just thinking about what we went through," Rodgers said, referring to pandemic season.
"It got me emotional with the crowd out there today.
I'm just really happy about everything that happened today."
He has every right to be.
The Packers pounded and passed the ball with impressive efficiency against the best defense in the league.
They ran for 188 yards, threw for 296, didn't get sacked or turn it over, and executed situationally like they have all season, converting two-thirds of their third downs (8-for-12) and three-quarters of their red-zone chances until the final kneel-downs near the LA 10-yard line after the two-minute warning made them officially 3-for-5.
That's when Rodgers was serenaded with the MVP chants, and he quietly soaked them in as yet another piece of this strange, standout season to treasure.
"It's hard to really put into words how special that feeling is," Rodgers said.
"But you can feel it.
It's so palpable.
You can feel that energy in the stadium.
It's just different.
It's different playing in front of a crowd.
It is."
There'll be another one next Sunday to watch Rodgers play for a Super Bowl berth at Lambeau Field.
He's been waiting, patiently, for this chance.
"It will be exciting to enjoy this tonight, to celebrate and then to watch the game tomorrow," he said, "and to know that whoever wins is coming to our place."

Tyler Lancaster’s one-year deal with the Green Bay Packers included a small signing bonus and has a cap hit of just under $1.25 million in 2021.
According to Tom Silverstein of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, the Packers gave Lancaster a signing bonus of $200,000 on a deal that will count $1,248,438 on the salary cap this season.
Lancaster, who was originally a restricted free agent, agreed to return to Green Bay on a one-year deal above the minimum amount but lower than than the $2.1 million restricted tender.
The move brings back an experienced rotational player along the defensive line at a cheap and reasonable cost.
Lancaster, an undrafted free agent out of Northwestern in 2018, has played in 43 games for the Packers over his first three NFL seasons.
He has 79 career tackles, three tackles for losses and 1.5 sacks.
The Packers have played Lancaster for 1,004 defensive snaps over the last three seasons.
He has been used mostly as a block-eating and space-consuming defender against the run.
Lancaster, 26, will be an unrestricted free agent when his one-year deal expires following the 2021 season.

Free agent offensive lineman Lane Taylor visited his second team since the start of the new league year.
According to the league's transaction wire, Taylor – a starter for the Green Bay Packers to open the 2020 season – visited the Houston Texans on Monday.
Taylor visited the San Francisco 49ers last month.
Both teams likely want to check in on his recovery from the ACL injury he suffered in Week 1 of last year.
Taylor took a pay cut and returned to the Packers in 2020, and a strong summer earned him the starting job at right guard.
He was lost...
Daniel Jeremiah's latest mock draft for NFL.com has the Green Bay Packers getting help for the interior of the offensive line in the first round.
Jeremiah sent Alabama offensive lineman Landon Dickerson to the Packers at No.
29 overall.
From Jeremiah: "Dickerson is the best pure interior offensive linemen available.
I thought he might fall out of the first round after his ACL injury, but it appears his recovery is going smoothly.
He can step in following the departure of Corey Linsley."
Dickerson is Jeremiah's No.
40 overall prospect in the draft class, mostly due to injuries.

The first episode of Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers hosting "Jeopardy!"
aired Monday.
The three-time MVP has nine more episodes airing over the next two weeks.
How did Rodgers do during his opening appearance?
It's time to go to the tape to evaluate the performance.
Here's a light-hearted breakdown of Rodgers' first episode as guest host (note: spoilers ahead):
– Solid intro.
Looks confident, ready for the moment.
Possibly too much swaying back and forth.
He might be fighting some nerves, and that's just fine.
– Terrific job reading the opening categories.

“Jeopardy!” episodes guest hosted by Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers will begin airing nationally on Monday, April 5.
The three-time NFL MVP provided a behind-the-scenes look at the experience during a 10-minute interview with the show.
Rodgers talked about his love of the show, how he honored Alex Trebek’s memory as a host, his favorite memories of Trebek, how he calmed his nerves before the filming, the parallels between hosting and playing football, handling contestant interviews and the best potential players among his NFL peers and why he picked the North Valley Community Foundation.
Rodgers also challenged offensive linemen David Bakhtiari, Corey Linsley and Lucas Patrick to a friendly game of “Jeopardy!”
“I would love to see my offensive linemen, who I love so much, but who are also very opinionated guys who think they are absolutely brilliant humans…I’d like to see those three guys, right up here on the stage…just see how well they do,” Rodgers said.

Aaron Jones is back with the Packers, and A.J.
Dillon is entering Year 2.
But does that mean Green Bay won’t select running back in the upcoming draft?
Not necessarily.
Jamaal Williams played 418 snaps last season but is now signed with the Detroit Lions.
Dillon will probably absorb most of the reps Williams saw in 2020, however, Matt LaFleur likes having a stable of running backs – preferably three – at his disposal.
If the Packers want to add another running back to the mix this off-season, they could select University of Buffalo’s Jaret Patterson with a Day 3 pick.
Patterson produced 3,884 rushing yards and 52 rushing touchdowns on 636 attempts over three years playing for the Bulls.
Standing at 5-7 and weighing 195 pounds, Patterson is a bowling ball for a running back.
He also has decent speed after running a 4.52 at his pro day.
When I watch Patterson play, I see a slasher-style running back, much like Jones is for Green Bay.
To learn more about what kind of player Patterson is, let’s look at some of his college film:
Jaret Patterson knows when to be patient, but he also knows when to run with conviction.
Patterson can get downhill in a hurry.
pic.twitter.com/VEBH312UYX
— Brandon Carwile (@PackerScribe) February 12, 2021
Let’s start with Patterson’s speed.
4.5 is plenty fast for a running back, so Patterson shouldn’t have speed concerns at the next level.
In the first clip, Patterson takes the hand off from the pistol and shotgun, therefore, he has more time to accelerate before getting to the line of scrimmage.
Still, I think Patterson has solid burst to get advantageous angles against tacklers, even when the quarterback is under center.
Sometimes a run call or scheme will call for patience, other times, you may have to make up your mind in a hurry.
Patterson can do both using his vision, and these are a couple of good examples of him running with conviction when the hole is there.
Patterson has some wiggle to his game.
Glides into his jukes and can make guys miss even in tight spaces.
pic.twitter.com/mDsXLsbuz6
— Brandon Carwile (@PackerScribe) February 10, 2021
Patterson isn’t just a bowling ball.
He has some legit fluidity to his footwork, which allows him to slip through arm tackles and pick up extra yardage.
Patterson doesn’t need a ton of room either.
He will juke or cut in an instant, even while in a phone booth to make a guy miss.
Always conscious of the football.
Love the nuances in Patterson’s game.
pic.twitter.com/MrW5PqAwSx
— Brandon Carwile (@PackerScribe) April 4, 2021
An awesome juke here that also exemplifies Patterson’s nuances as a runner.
After completing his move, he switches hands to protect the ball away from the next defender.
This is a great example of his mental processing and thinking one step ahead.
Still really like Jaret Patterson as a day 3 pick.
Tough runner that refuses to go down on first contact.
pic.twitter.com/tHaZmZSe4I
— Brandon Carwile (@PackerScribe) April 4, 2021
Even though we’ve seen Patterson showcase his shiftiness, he can run also behind his pads.
This type of play strength makes him tough to bring down and use his compact build to his advantage.
In the play above, we see Patterson spin out of one tackle and then use a stiff arm to gain 10 extra yards.
If this clip reminds Packers fans of anyone, it’s Aaron Jones.
Patterson is a smaller back, but he still has plenty of power.
pic.twitter.com/sNQ6N9ZcS8
— Brandon Carwile (@PackerScribe) February 10, 2021
One thing that sticks out about Patterson is his mental toughness.
Despite size limitations, he doesn’t let that define him as a player.
Patterson can carry a pile of defenders a couple of extra yards if it means putting his offense in better position.
More tough running from Patterson.
This time inside the 5. pic.twitter.com/oSmEoOMdsl
— Brandon Carwile (@PackerScribe) February 10, 2021
Patterson can make a career out of second-effort runs.
His contact balance is one of his better traits.
Jaret Patterson is not afraid to put his body on the line in pass protection.
Love to see this kind of toughness.
pic.twitter.com/zV2frnJPME
— Brandon Carwile (@PackerScribe) February 10, 2021
One thing that sticks out about Patterson is his willingness in pass protection.
He’s not afraid to step in front of a blitz even when he knows he’s about to get punished.
This type of mindset is extremely valuable, and would certainly come in hand in Green Bay, where running backs are expected to pass protect.
What a block by Patterson pic.twitter.com/J0naVKx1xV
— Brandon Carwile (@PackerScribe) April 4, 2021
Here we see Patterson cut block a blitzing linebacker.
This is excellent technique and execution.
Jaret Patterson is a capable blocker.
This skill set will transition nicely to the next level.
pic.twitter.com/NNOTFOBjS4
— Brandon Carwile (@PackerScribe) February 10, 2021
Still not convinced about Patterson’s blocking ability?
Here is another play with him in pass protection and also a play where he is utilized as a run blocker.
During the second play, Patterson drives and finishes against a defender that is much bigger than him.
Notice the technique he uses to position his body to create a gap for his fellow running back, who runs for a huge gain.
This is a tremendous display of Patterson’s versatility and why he will be a good fit on an NFL roster.
Of course, there are some things Patterson will need to work on at the next level.
In a running back by committee, Patterson should be able to find snaps but probably not in short-yardage situations.
Patterson may struggle in short-yardage situations, but he is always going to fight.
This is the kind of mentality you want on your team.
pic.twitter.com/bhregmlBlK
— Brandon Carwile (@PackerScribe) April 4, 2021
Asking him to gut it out against stacked boxes, whether it be third and short or down at the goal line, is not how he is best utilized.
Still, even when the odds are against him, we see Patterson lunge for the end zone for the touchdown.
He’s an unbelievable competitor.
An area Patterson needs to work on is his ability as a receiver.
He has the tools to be an effective back on angle routes and swings routes, but that wasn’t something he was asked to do much of in college.
In 2020, he actually didn’t catch a single pass.
If Patterson can find a way to be a viable option as a receiving back, it will help him get on the field more as a pro.
People will say Patterson didn’t face the strongest competition in college.
It’s a legitimate critique, but his film highlights a lot of characteristics that are hard to ignore.
Yes, Patterson probably won’t jump onto the scene and become a starter right away, but he could be an asset on special teams and as a No.
2 or 3 running back.
That is why he is a good fit for the Packers.
Having him learn behind a consummate pro like Jones could do wonders for his development.
Green Bay has seven picks on Day 3 of the 2021 draft.
If Patterson is still hanging around, it may be wise to take a late-round flier on a third running back that can pretty much do it all.

The Green Bay Packers in partnership with Bellin Health and Brown County Public Health today announced that the Lambeau Field Atrium will host a community COVID-19 vaccination site that will be open to eligible community members beginning Wednesday, March 17.
Vaccine prioritization is occurring in accordance with the guidelines established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Wisconsin Department of Health Services.
Visit dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/vaccine-about.htm for the most up-to-date information on currently eligible groups.
The Lambeau Field vaccination clinic initially will operate in the Atrium and may expand to other areas of the stadium as supply and weather allow, said Bellin Health President and CEO Chris Woleske.
With adequate supply, the site will have capacity to vaccinate 6,000 individuals per week initially and quickly ramp up to 10,000 individuals weekly.
"This is a true community effort to get shots in arms, and we couldn't ask for better partners in this effort than Brown County Public Health and the Green Bay Packers," Woleske said.
"We want to make it as easy as possible for all who are eligible to get vaccinated, which ultimately will be our ticket out of this pandemic and back to our normal lives."
The three partners have made equitable access the centerpiece of their plans to launch the Lambeau Field site, said Brown County Health Officer Anna Destree.
"We understand and take to heart the need to place equitable distribution at the core of this planning, from engaging community partners and ensuring adequate transportation to educating and building vaccine confidence with underserved communities," Destree said.
"We have created an extensive equity plan, and we are eager for this opportunity to equitably serve the Brown County community and beyond.
Lambeau Field provides a centralized, well-known and accessible location for a community vaccination site to serve Brown County and the surrounding areas, and the stadium's flexible event spaces can be adjusted as needed to accommodate vaccine distribution.
Lambeau Field adds to more than a dozen NFL facilities that are being used as vaccine sites throughout the country.
"We are proud to be a part of this team effort, and the Packers organization remains committed to doing everything we can to stop the spread of COVID-19," said Packers President/CEO Mark Murphy.
"We know the only way we can help bring an end to this pandemic and see Lambeau Field full of fans again is if a significant portion of our community receives the vaccine once they are eligible."
Individuals will not need to be Bellin Health patients to be vaccinated at Lambeau Field, but appointments will be required.
No walk-ins will be accepted at this time.
Eligible individuals may call (920) 445-7313 to add their names to an appointment waitlist.
Please note: Only individuals who qualify for the current phase of vaccination will be able to schedule vaccines.
The Lambeau Field site will replace Bellin's current Green Bay vaccination site on the Bellin Health Ashwaubenon clinic campus.
Vaccinations will be given in the Lambeau Field Atrium, with signage to assist in wayfinding and social distancing.
Individuals should park in Lot 3 off Lombardi Avenue on the east side of Lambeau Field, enter through the American Family Insurance Gate and proceed to the Atrium's main level via escalator, stairs or elevator.
Masks are required at all times.
After receiving their vaccine, individuals will need to wait 15 minutes for monitoring before departing.
A limited valet service will be made available for individuals who have mobility challenges.
Bellin Health will share additional details about vaccination prioritization and process as they become available.
More information about COVID-19 and the vaccine is available at bellin.org/covid19.

The Green Bay Packers got creative with Marcedes Lewis’ new deal to help lower his 2021 cap hit.
According to Rob Demovsky of ESPN, the Packers added voidable years in 2023 and 2024 to help spread out the proration of the signing bonus for Lewis, who will now have a cap hit of just under $2.4 million in 2021.
The two added void years allow the Packers to spread out his $2.1 million signing bonus over four years instead of two, lowering the cap hit in the first two years, but the Packers will have a dead cap hit to pay when the void years eventually kick in.
The team also used void years on restructures for Mason Crosby and Adrian Amos and a new deal for Kevin King.
The deal for Lewis is for two years and pays out $8 million in cash, including a roster bonus of just over $2 million on the third day of the new league year in 2022.
The Packers will owe just over $1 million in dead money (prorated signing bonus for 2023 and 2024) when the deal voids in 2023.
Lewis, who turns 37 next month, has played over 900 total offensive snaps for Matt LaFleur and the Packers over the last two seasons.
He’s the offense’s top inline tight end and one of the best blocking tight ends in the NFL.
The Packers put in $1.4 million in total per-game roster bonuses and $1 million in total workout bonuses into the deal for 2021 and 2022.
Both are incentives the team often uses for veterans.
The cap hit for Lewis will be $2.38 million in 2021 and $4.52 million in 2022.
Strapped by the cap this year, the Packers needed to use cap tricks to keep his number low in 2021.
More and more teams have used voidable years in contracts to navigate the salary cap shrinking this year.
This contract is the fourth between Lewis and the Packers.
He played on one-year deals in 2018, 2019 and 2020.

GREEN BAY – The roar of the Lambeau Field crowd reached its peak after ﻿Robert Tonyan﻿ crouched down to catch an 8-yard touchdown from ﻿Aaron Rodgers﻿ early in the third quarter.
As good as it felt to find paydirt, the Packers were going to need one or two big defensive plays to claw back into Sunday's NFC Championship Game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
The defense gave them three.
Hope came in the form of defensive backs ﻿Adrian Amos﻿ and ﻿Jaire Alexander﻿ intercepting future Hall of Fame quarterback Tom Brady on back-to-back-to-back possessions.
While it wasn't enough as the Packers came up short in their comeback attempt in a disappointing 31-26 defeat, the three takeaways gave Green Bay a chance in the fourth quarter.
"Really felt the game turn around and just our momentum get picked up," said defensive tackle ﻿Kenny Clark﻿ of the consecutive takeaways.
"It felt like we were doing a really good job, third and fourth quarter, getting turnovers, get pressure in his face, making him throw the ball up and our DBs did a great job of getting the ball."
It was the type of response the defense was looking for following a rough start to Sunday's title game, which began with Brady converting three third downs through the air during a nine-play, 66-yard touchdown drive to start the game.
Big plays haunted the Packers in the second quarter with Brady connecting on a 52-yard pass to Chris Godwin on third-and-9, one of seven third downs Tampa Bay converted in the first half.
Leonard Fournette scored on a 20-yard TD run on the next play.
Prior to halftime, after it looked like the Buccaneers might punt on fourth-and-4, head coach Bruce Arians opted to put his offense back on the field and Fournette caught a 6-yard pass to move the chains.
On the very next play, Brady lofted a deep ball down the sideline and over the single coverage of ﻿Kevin King﻿ into the hands of Scotty Miller for a 39-yard touchdown that put Tampa Bay up 21-10 at halftime.
"At the end of the half, that's a play that can't happen," Amos said.
"Situations like that, we can't give up a big play.
That's one of those plays.
We had a couple drives here and there where we couldn't get off the field on third down and it came back to haunt us."
An ﻿Aaron Jones﻿ fumble on the opening possession of the second half resulted in Tampa Bay taking over at the Green Bay 8, leading to a TD pass to Cam Brate that put the Buccaneers up by three scores.
That's when momentum began to turn.
First, Rodgers led an eight-play, 75-yard drive that ended with the TD pass to Tonyan.
Then, Amos picked off Brady on an overthrown pass for Mike Evans at the Green Bay 32.
Seven minutes and 13 plays later, the Packers exchanged the takeaway for a 2-yard TD pass to ﻿Davante Adams﻿.
With the Packers within five entering the fourth quarter, All-Pro cornerback ﻿Jaire Alexander﻿ picked off a ball over the fingertips of Evans with 12:34 left in the game and did it again on the next series after a ﻿Darnell Savage﻿ blitz.
Unfortunately for Green Bay, the offense would go three-and-out on both possessions.
Lambeau Field hosted the NFC Championship Game between the Green Bay Packers and Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday, Jan. 24, 2021.
The Packers and Buccaneers would go on to trade field goals in the final five minutes of the game, with the defense having one more chance at a stop with two minutes remaining.
After two Fournette runs for six yards, the Packers would see their Super Bowl dreams dashed when back judge Perry Paganelli threw a late flag for defensive pass interference on King in coverage of Tyler Johnson.
It was one of six penalties Clete Blakeman's crew called Sunday, with the first coming with 7 minutes, 53 seconds to go in the third quarter.
"I feel like it was great coverage, tripped on his foot," Clark said.
"The referees were letting everybody play all game.
They were chipping up our receivers.
They made a call in a critical situation that changed the game.
But I think momentum was on our side.
We were doing a really good job.
"But it is what it is.
We can't blame it on that.
We're bigger than that.
Just got to just be better, try not to be in that situation at the end of the game.
Just starting faster would be better situationally."
It was a bitter way to end the season for a Green Bay defense that improved as the year went on, finishing inside the top 10 in total defense for the first time since 2010.
"It's kind of surreal.
This is not the end that we expected," Amos said.
"I think we had full confidence in the locker room we were going to the Super Bowl.
It's just a shock because you want to win.
It's still hitting us."

GREEN BAY – ﻿Kenny Clark﻿ could feel the energy reverberate throughout Lambeau Field as more than 8,000 fans in attendance shouted and smacked their signs against the metal bleachers.
In that moment, as noise polluted the stadium bowl for practically the first time all season, it was almost like a little bit of diesel that had been missing was reinjected back into the D-Train.
In the end, a Packers defense that's been on the rise over the past two months responded with a statement in the waning moments of Saturday's 32-18 win over the Los Angeles Rams to advance to the NFC Championship Game.
The win didn't come without its moments of adversity, but the defense again succeeded at containing the run (96 yards allowed), eliminating explosive plays (two catches for more than 20 yards) and pressuring the quarterback (a season-high four sacks allowed of Jared Goff).
Afterward, there was no question in the mind of Clark and his fellow defenders where it all began.
"We were talking about that in the locker room.
It was great to have the fans back, hitting the signs on the stands and just the noise period," said the fifth-year defensive lineman.
"Their snap count is a huge part of their game and I couldn't hear their snap count."
The Packers knew how critical it was going to be to not only stop rookie running back Cam Akers, but also not allow the Rams to get into an early rhythm.
After all, Los Angeles is 37-0 all-time under Sean McVay when leading at halftime.
The Rams went three-and-out on their first possession, with ﻿Preston Smith﻿ batting a pass at the line of scrimmage on third-and-6, and again came up empty in the second quarter after ﻿Za'Darius Smith﻿ sacked Goff on second down.
LA still made its share of plays, including a nine-play, 75-yard touchdown drive before halftime and another lengthy series at the end of the third quarter to cut Green Bay's lead to seven.
Every time the defense needed a response, however, it found one, whether it was Clark and ﻿Rashan Gary﻿ combining for a sack on a three-and-out in the third quarter or Clark's solo sack of Goff early in the fourth that helped force a much-needed punt.
Fittingly, it was a sum of all the defensive parts that shut the door on the Rams in the final seven minutes of the game with All-Pro cornerback ﻿Jaire Alexander﻿ dropping Robert Woods for a 3-yard loss on a receiver screen on second-and-10.
According to NFL NextGen stats, that screen pass to Woods was the only time Alexander was the nearest defender on a reception.
He was targeted just three times.
After Preston Smith deflected another pass on third down, Gary then sacked Goff after the Rams' quarterback stepped up in the pocket, dropping him for a 4-yard loss to force turnover on downs.
"That's our game.
That's what our defense is about," Clark said.
"You gotta win.
We gotta keep winning first down.
When we do that, we get guys in long situations.
When we're able to do that, we have guys who are able to rush and get after the quarterback."
Linebacker ﻿Krys Barnes﻿ exited briefly with a thumb injury but still led the defense with 10 tackles after returning with a cast on his left hand.
Other than that, the Packers' defense appears to be as healthy and confident as can be heading into a showdown with either Tampa Bay or New Orleans next Sunday at Lambeau Field.
"We got either a dome team coming in here or a team that plays in 85-degree weather every day coming here," Clark said.
"I know everybody's going to be excited to finally have a home game for one of these NFC Championship games.
We gotta just give it everything we got.
This is the big (one).
We gotta get to the Super Bowl."
The O-line does it again: A Packers offensive line still looking to find its comfort zone without All-Pro left tackle ﻿David Bakhtiari﻿ earned another big feather in its cap against the Rams.
The Packers held the Rams' front at bay, preventing quarterback ﻿Aaron Rodgers﻿ from being sacked and paving the way to a 188-yard day on the ground for the running game.
In fact, the Packers became the first team in NFL playoff history to register 475-plus yards of total offense and 175-plus rushing yards with zero sacks allowed and zero turnovers in a game.
"Our guys came out physical, ready to play, ready for the challenge and I'm so proud of them," running back ﻿Aaron Jones﻿ said.
"They accepted the challenge, they stood there and they did their thing and they did their job, kept A-Rod clean and kept the run lanes clean, as well."
'A scrappy dude': ﻿Elgton Jenkins﻿ had a coming-of-age moment in the second quarter when the Pro Bowl guard drew an unnecessary roughness penalty from a frustrated Aaron Donald.
Donald was flagged for putting his hands up on Jenkins' facemask after an Rodgers pass for ﻿Davante Adams﻿ fell incomplete.
Instead of third-and-7 at the LA 36, the penalty made it first-and-10 at the 21.
Rodgers would later scramble in for a 1-yard touchdown to give the Packers a 16-3 lead.
Donald, who was playing through a rib injury, had just one tackle in 39 defensive snaps.
"Dave (Bakhtiari) and I were just talking about that after the game," Linsley said.
"We're very, very proud of Elgton because he's a scrappy dude.
For him to be able to restrain himself and exercise that level … we were proud of him.
That was an awesome move by him, got us 15 yards and made a difference in that drive."
Lambeau Field hosted an NFC Divisional playoff matchup between the Green Bay Packers and Los Angeles Rams on Saturday, Jan. 16, 2021.
Toughing it out: It isn't just luck that's allowed Mason Crosby to play in 224 consecutive regular-season games.
It also takes a lot of toughness to forge a streak that spans 14 NFL seasons.
That mentality was on full display after Crosby appeared to injure his shoulder after an aborted extra point in the second quarter.
He stayed in the game, handling kickoffs and even making a 39-yard field goal before halftime.
"As far as Mason's shoulder is concerned, it showed a lot of grit and toughness to come back in the game," LaFleur said.
"I know he's not 100%, but he came through and delivered big for us."

GREEN BAY – It's the prognosis no NFL quarterback ever wants to receive about his starting left tackle, let alone one the caliber of ﻿David Bakhtiari﻿.
Three days before the regular-season finale against the Chicago Bears, ﻿Aaron Rodgers﻿ and the Packers were informed the five-time All-Pro was lost for the season to a significant knee injury he suffered in practice.
In many NFL cities, such news would send a cold chill down the spine of a locker room.
It's a platonic shift that could derail not only an offensive line but also dash a team's hopes for a championship season.
Yet, as important as Bakhtiari is to the Packers' success, his injury has been just another detour for an offensive line that's learned how to deal with adversity in an appropriate manner.
That's where ﻿Billy Turner﻿ comes in – the charismatic seventh-year veteran who's become a locker-room favorite in Green Bay through his positive personality and versatile skill set over the past two years.
Even now, days out from the NFC Championship Game, quarterback Aaron Rodgers smiles thinking back the first time he met Turner after he signed with the Packers in March 2019.
"I knew nothing other than when I met him, he asked to be called Bill," said Rodgers on Wednesday.
"At that point, I don't think I knew anyone under 50 named Bill.
"Here's this mountain of a man with dreds and glasses and a super-cool outfit wanting to be called Bill.
That was pretty interesting.
I think he's definitely one of the unsung heroes of the season for so many reasons."
Perhaps the biggest reason is his versatility.
Turner started all 18 games (including playoffs) at right guard a year ago before relocating to right tackle this year following the return of veteran guard ﻿Lane Taylor﻿.
At least, that was the plan until injuries surfaced.
First, Turner would make three midseason starts at left tackle for Bakhtiari after he injured his ribs against Tampa Bay in Week 6.
By December, Turner slid back to right guard due to shuffling on the offensive line in the wake of ﻿Corey Linsley﻿ going on IR with a knee injury of his own.
Just when it looked like he might go back to right tackle, Turner was asked to slide back to left tackle after Bakhtiari's incident in practice.
To date, according to Pro Football Focus, Turner has played 423 snaps at right tackle, 292 at left tackle and another 244 at right guard.
And the 6-foot-5, 310-pound lineman hasn't just filled in – he's thrived.
"The reality of this football season for me is no different than my entire career," said Turner last week.
"I never know what position I'm playing — from a Monday, to the day before the game, or two days before the game like it was with Dave.
You just never know."
The Packers' offensive line has been in constant state of flux for most of the year, with Taylor landing on season-ending IR back in September after tearing his ACL in the opener at Minnesota.
Yet, the Packers still led the NFL in scoring (31.8 points per game) behind the most efficient red-zone offense in the last four years (80%).
Rodgers, a favorite to win his third MVP award in two weeks' time, was sacked just 21 times, his fewest in a 16-game regular season.
Turner has been a big reason for Rodgers' uniform staying so clean this season.
While Turner isn't as burly as most NFL offensive linemen, his athleticism seems to be what separates him from others at his position…or positions.
"I've always felt Billy's best position was tackle, in general," offensive line coach Adam Stenavich said.
"When we could move him out there, I felt better having him out there.
Him going to left tackle, he's played a lot of different positions over his career.
… He's a pretty reliable guy in general.
"If he can get his mind right that week for whatever position he's going to play, I feel really good about him out there doing his thing and being productive."
As he's had more time to settle in at left tackle, Turner has only gotten better.
He and the offensive line kept Rodgers clean last Saturday against the Los Angeles Rams, enabling the Packers to put up 484 total yards and 32 points on the NFL's top-ranked defense.
One win away from the franchise's first Super Bowl appearance in a decade, the Packers know they'll have their hands full against Tampa Bay and Pro Bowl pass rusher Jason Pierre-Paul this Sunday.
The Green Bay Packers practiced on Clarke Hinkle Field on Wednesday, Jan. 20, 2021.

Rodgers has confidence Turner is ready to do his part, especially after being twice pitted against Chicago's All-Pro edge rusher Khalil Mack in 2020.
As much as Rodgers misses Bakhtiari, he puts Turner's calmness and preparation right up with those of Bakhtiari, Bryan Bulaga and all the other great tackles that have come before him in Green Bay.
Turner appreciates the support but that doesn't shake his focus off the real goal – advancing to, and winning, the Super Bowl.
"I've never been a guy to brag or to gloat or to rest on any type of accomplishments or anything like that," Turner said.
"The only thing that I am chasing is a victory at the end of that week and championships.
That is it.
Super Bowls are more important to me and championships and helping this team win games are more important to me than anything else."

The Green Bay Packers re-signed CB ﻿Kevin King﻿.
The transaction was announced Friday by General Manager Brian Gutekunst.
King, who was originally selected by the Packers in the second round of the 2017 NFL Draft (No.
33 overall), has played in 41 games with 36 starts during his first four seasons.
He has posted 169 tackles (129 solo), six interceptions, 34 passes defensed, six tackles for a loss, a sack, a QB hit, two forced fumbles and two fumble recoveries.
Among NFL cornerbacks who played 500-plus snaps during the 2020 regular season, King was targeted the sixth-fewest times (51) and had the eighth-fewest burns with 32 (occurs when a targeted defensive player allows a completed pass), according to Sportradar.
He has started all four postseason contests he has appeared in, recording 19 tackles (14 solo), three passes defensed and a tackle for a loss.
Take a look at photos of Green Bay Packers CB Kevin King through the years.

Packers team historian
Brad from Grafton, WI
Love your work.
First, what is your unbiased assessment of Dan Devine and the 1972 Packers?
Second, I have always had the impression – because of Packers publications – that the organization has made an effort to downplay the accomplishments of the 1972 team under Devine.
Fans who saw that team firsthand have spoken more favorably about it.
And with a little NFL Films research, it seems to me to be a very interesting and talented team that didn't win the NFC Central Division accidentally.
I realize I probably don't have the whole story, and that is why I look to you to clear up the disconnect.
Thanks for being a reader and you are absolutely correct: The 1972 Packers, the best of the 24 teams during the post-Lombardi drought, didn't win the division by accident.
Lee Remmel covered the Packers for the Green Bay Press-Gazette from 1945 to early 1974, when Devine hired him to be director of public relations.
Thereafter, Remmel worked for the Packers until 2007.
That's a span of more than 60 years, stretching from the end of the Curly Lambeau era to the start of Mike McCarthy's reign, and Remmel always marveled at how well the 1972 team played down the stretch.
"I'll say this, I think the Packer team in the last four, five, six weeks of that '72 season played as well as any Packer team I've ever seen," Remmel told me in 2002.
That's high praise from someone who covered all five of Vince Lombardi's NFL championship teams as a reporter and then had an insider's view of the 1996 Packers.
To your point about the organization downplaying the accomplishments of that team, I think Lee's comments are proof that hasn't been the case.
Also, keep in mind, the Packers have won 13 NFL championships and the 1972 team is one of 16 others in club history that won a division or conference title but not a league championship.
Thus, I don't think they've been overlooked any more than the 1938 or 1960 or 1995 or 2003 or 2011 or any of the 10 other Packers teams that matched their accomplishments.
But take nothing away from what was the only Packers team to win a division between Lombardi's last season and Mike Holmgren's fourth season.
In 1972, I was in my second year as a sportswriter at the Press-Gazette and while my main beat in the fall was covering high school football, I was assigned to write about at least three Packers home games that season, including the Dec. 3 showdown against Detroit that gave them the inside track on winning the NFC Central Division.
It was a frigid Sunday afternoon at Lambeau Field and the game was no contest.
The Packers dominated 33-7.
The following week, they were just as impressive, beating the Vikings, 23-7, on another brutally cold day at the old Met in Minnesota to clinch the division.
As I think back off the top of my head, I can't remember any Packers team ever looking any better in back-to-back late-season games with so much at stake.
MacArthur Lane and John Brockington were as good a backfield tandem as any the Packers have had since Paul Hornung and Jim Taylor were in their prime in the early 1960s.
Brockington and Lane rushed for a combined 1,848 yards.
The offensive line was solid, as well, although perennial all-pro guard Gale Gillingham was moved to defense and then lost for the season in the second game due to injury.
The defense ranked second in the league in fewest yards allowed and second against the run.
Defensive tackle Bob Brown and linebacker Fred Carr made the Pro Bowl.
Willie Buchanon and Ken Ellis played as well as any cornerback tandem I can remember, at least since Herb Adderley and Bob Jeter in 1967.
Maybe Charles Woodson and Al Harris played at a similar level during a stretch from 2007 to 2009.
But Buchanon was the AP's NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year and Ellis was an AP All-Pro.
This is a strong statement, but I don't know that I've seen a Packers cornerback since Adderley have a better year than Buchanon did even as a rookie in terms of shutting down receivers and forcing on the run.
Woodson made more big plays in his best years in Green Bay, but Buchanon was younger, faster and a textbook tackler before he broke his leg twice in three years.
At linebacker, besides Carr, the Packers also had Pro Football Hall of Famer Dave Robinson and Jim Carter, who was selected to the Pro Bowl a year later.
The only linebacker trio that I can think of that played better since the Lombardi era was Carr, Carter and Ted Hendricks two years later, only because Hendricks was in the prime of his career and Robinson was 31 and two years removed from an Achilles tendon injury in 1972.
As for Brown, this might sound crazy, but he could overpower blockers and toss them around like Reggie White during his moments of brilliance.
Discovered by personnel director Pat Peppler while playing for the Wheeling Ironmen of the Continental Football League, Brown was a 27-year-old rookie in 1966 and played as a reserve on two of Lombardi's championship teams.
He also had his best year in 1972.
Otherwise, he fought a constant battle with his weight and was never in good enough shape to dominate consistently.
Another key to that 1972 team was rookie kicker Chester Marcol, who kicked 33 field goals.
He still shares the club record for most field goals in a season.
The only weakness on that '72 team was the passing game.
The Packers ranked 25th out of 26 teams.
Starting wide receivers Carroll Dale and Leland Glass caught 16 and 15 passes, respectively.
Scott Hunter, the starting quarterback, was in his second year and had suffered a shoulder injury in college that robbed him of velocity on the passes that separate great quarterbacks from the rest.
That said, Hunter had something working in his favor that can't be quantified: His teammates responded to his leadership.
To this day, players on that team believe they could have won the Super Bowl if not for Devine.
They lost to Washington, 16-3, in the NFC Divisional Playoff and then Washington lost to unbeaten Miami, 14-7, in the Super Bowl.
Clearly, Miami with Don Shula and Washington with George Allen had a bigger edge there than they did among players, but that's another subject to be covered in our book on the 100-year history of the Packers, due out later this year.
For now, I'm just going to refer you to this oral history with guard Bill Lueck and this one with Brockington.
Ned from Green Bay
I've been so impressed with your Packers Heritage Trail project over the years.
We just inherited a trunk from my in-laws and I'm wondering if it looks like it might be an authentic and maybe date back to the 1940s.
It's got the No.
14 on it in several places.
Have you ever seen one of these?
Glad you've enjoyed the Heritage Trail.
As for the trunk, no, I've never seen one.
The Heritage Auction site has posted pictures of trunks from the 1960s, but I didn't find one from the '40s.
Again, I'm in no position to determine if that was once Don Hutson's trunk, but I believe it certainly could have been.
I can't imagine that the players from his era didn't all have large trunks to use on team trips.
When Hutson played from 1935-45, the Packers almost always traveled by train and often were on the road for extended periods of time.
Back then, the Packers usually played all or almost all of their home games early in the season and then finished up with a series of games on the road.
And they'd stay on the road without returning home in between games.
Consequently, they had to carry a lot of baggage, including everyday clothing and other items, as well as their team gear for both games and practices.
Here, for example, was what Hutson's life was like in 1936, when he won his first championship.
The Packers started the season playing their first six games at home – four in Green Bay and two in Milwaukee – before playing their last six on the road at Chicago, Boston, Brooklyn, New York, Detroit and Chicago for a second time.
The Packers departed Green Bay on a train on Friday, Nov. 6, arrived in Boston Saturday morning, stayed at the Parker House, won on Sunday and then caught a train on Monday for New York.
Their plan was to stay at Blue Hill Golf Course, near Orangeburg, about 30 miles north of New York City, and work out there for the next two weeks.
But Lambeau didn't like the arrangements, so within two days, he moved the team into Manhattan.
The practice field at Blue Hill wasn't protected from the cold winds and, worse, "made-over barns" there served as dormitories, according to George Calhoun, secretary of the Packers and telegraph editor of the Press-Gazette.
Upon moving into New York, the Packers stayed at the Hotel Victoria and practiced on the West Meadow football field in Central Park.
They beat the Dodgers and Giants on back-to-back weekends, and then caught a train to Detroit on Wednesday, Nov. 25.
There, they stayed at the Statler Hotel, enjoyed a turkey dinner on Thanksgiving, worked out at the University of Detroit and beat the Lions on Sunday for their ninth straight victory.
They also clinched the Western Division title and were greeted by 3,000 fans at the Milwaukee Road depot when they returned home the next day.
Five days later, the Packers took a train to Chicago for their finale against the Cardinals and then returned home Sunday night.
At 7 a.m. Tuesday, they boarded another train and arrived in New York 24 hours later for the league championship game against Boston.
The Packers stayed at the Victoria again and practiced again in Central Park.
They won the title with a 21-6 victory over Boston on Sunday and arrived home at 10:30 p.m. Monday, when they were greeted at the Milwaukee Road depot by an estimated 10,000 fans.
Two weeks later, the Packers reconvened in Denver to begin preparation for a more than month-long barnstorming trip that would include five games: one in Denver, one in San Francisco and three in Los Angeles.
Nothing like making a short story long just to let you know that trunks were likely a necessity.
But that was a typical schedule for the Packers teams of the 1920s through the '40s.
Here's something else we know: No Packers player has worn No.
14 since Hutson in 1945.
However, seven players wore it previously, including two other Pro Football Hall of Famers: Lambeau in 1927 and Johnny Blood in 1933.
Lambeau, as you know, was a native of Green Bay; and John McNally, Blood's birth name, was from New Richmond, Wis. Hutson was originally from Arkansas, but lived in Green Bay while he played and later lived in Racine for more than a quarter-century.
My guess is that Hutson would have been the most likely owner of the trunk just based on the number of years he wore 14 and the time he spent in Wisconsin.
But I'd check with your in-laws for more information about where the trunk might have come from; if anybody in the family might have known any of those three Hall of Famers, or lived in any of those other Wisconsin cities.
Whatever you could find out would help.
One other name I might ask about, just to see if it rings a bell with anyone, is Paul Fitzgibbon, who wore No.
14 in 1931-32.
He was a native of South Dakota and became a doctor after he quit playing, practicing medicine in Long Beach, Calif.
I've heard from other players of that period that he was a good friend of Blood's and might have stayed in contact with some people in Green Bay.
In truth, someone with expertise in Packers memorabilia would be a better source than me to get to the bottom of it all.
But the more information you have the better off you'd be.
Randy from Green Bay
During the suspension of Packers stadium tours, I reviewed the information I present and checked it primarily through a variety of sources – mostly from Packers website notes and your Packers Heritage Trail book.
One of the statements that I say differs from many other guides is based on something I read a year or two ago, and you were the author.
It has to do with the three oldest teams in football.
I now say the Packers are the second oldest (Cardinals oldest and Bears third) based on what I read.
Can you point me to where you would have written that?
I truly appreciate your efforts to be accurate.
And, yes, it is accurate to say the Packers are the second oldest team in the NFL.
While I've written that on more than one occasion, I'm not exactly sure where you might have read it.
How about if I just answer the question again?
The Cardinals are the oldest team in the NFL, although they've moved from Chicago to St. Louis to the Phoenix area in the league's 101 seasons.
The Cardinals trace their roots to 1898 and the Morgan Athletic Club.
Unlike in Green Bay, where there was no direct connection between the Packers and the town teams that preceded them, the Cardinals can rightfully claim more than one direct link to the Morgan AC team, starting with one of its founders.
Chris O'Brien, who helped organize the team and then became captain in 1900, was still in charge of the Cardinals when they became charter members of the American Professional Football Association (now the NFL) in 1920.
In fact, O'Brien remained owner until 1929.
Another link was the nickname Cardinals, which was adopted in 1901.
Because the team belonged to a loosely organized Chicago league in its pre-NFL years and played its games at Normal Park, located along Racine Avenue, the team was called the Racine Cardinals and were still referred to by that name until the Racine (Wis.) Legion was admitted to the NFL in 1922.
Both the Cardinals and Decatur Staleys (now the Chicago Bears) were charter members of the APFA in 1920.
The Packers were admitted in 1921.
However, the Packers were founded in 1919, a year before the Bears (Staleys).
Until a number of authors over the last 30, 35 years started linking the Packers to those early town teams, the team itself in the 1950s, if not earlier, started its historical review in its own publications with the following sentence: "The Packers began in 1919 as a 'scrub' team of former Green Bay High School stars…" And no matter what others might have written nothing has changed.
The Packers started out as an alumni team of former Green Bay East and West high school players.
As I stated, you are now giving fans an accurate account of our history.
The Cardinals are the oldest team and the Packers the second oldest.
However, the Packers are third oldest in terms of membership in the NFL.
Then again, the Packers have been based in the same city longer than any team in the NFL.

The general manager of the Green Bay Packers is in Minnesota to see a pair of draft prospects at need positions participating during the school’s pro day.
According to Andrew Groover of NFL Network, Brian Gutekunst is one of at least two general managers at Minnesota’s pro day on Thursday, providing the Pakcers with an up-close look at Gophers receiver Rashod Bateman and cornerback Benjamin St-Juste.
Bateman (6-0, 190) is a potential first-round pick and one of the draft’s best receiver prospects.
He could be the first Minnesota player drafted in the first round since 2006.
In 2019, Bateman established himself as one of college football’s best receivers by producing 1,219 receiving yards and 11 touchdowns.
The Packers haven’t drafted a receiver in the first round since 2004, but Bateman could give Green Bay’s offense a long-term running mate for All-Pro Davante Adams.
St-Juste is a big cornerback with size (6-3, 202) similar to current Packers starter Kevin King.
His frame provides the opportunity to be a factor on the perimeter at the next level, although concerns about his overall athleticism exist.
He could be a mid-round prospect for the Packers if he checks some measurement boxes at Thursday’s pro day.

Free agent offensive lineman Lane Taylor visited his second team since the start of the new league year.
According to the league's transaction wire, Taylor – a starter for the Green Bay Packers to open the 2020 season – visited the Houston Texans on Monday.
Taylor visited the San Francisco 49ers last month.
Both teams likely want to check in on his recovery from the ACL injury he suffered in Week 1 of last year.
Taylor took a pay cut and returned to the Packers in 2020, and a strong summer earned him the starting job at right guard.
He was lost...
Daniel Jeremiah's latest mock draft for NFL.com has the Green Bay Packers getting help for the interior of the offensive line in the first round.
Jeremiah sent Alabama offensive lineman Landon Dickerson to the Packers at No.
29 overall.
From Jeremiah: "Dickerson is the best pure interior offensive linemen available.
I thought he might fall out of the first round after his ACL injury, but it appears his recovery is going smoothly.
He can step in following the departure of Corey Linsley."
Dickerson is Jeremiah's No.
40 overall prospect in the draft class, mostly due to injuries.
He suffered a torn...
The first episode of Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers hosting "Jeopardy!"
aired Monday.
The three-time MVP has nine more episodes airing over the next two weeks.
How did Rodgers do during his opening appearance?
It's time to go to the tape to evaluate the performance.
Here's a light-hearted breakdown of Rodgers' first episode as guest host (note: spoilers ahead):
– Solid intro.
Looks confident, ready for the moment.
Possibly too much swaying back and forth.
He might be fighting some nerves, and that's just fine.
– Terrific job reading the opening categories.

Hey everybody, thanks for logging on today.
Hope all is well with you and yours.
We can get started.
Is it accurate that if the Packers win both NFC games they have left, lose to Tennessee, but Saints lose to Chiefs, that no matter what Rams or Seahawks do Packers have the tie breaker in a three way at that point based on conference record?
Because that scenario sounds reasonably possible.
That sounds right.
I admit I haven't gone through all the details myself, but I think it could work out that way, yes.
Who is the Packers biggest threat in the playoffs?
I think the obvious answer is themselves considering how many times they shot themselves in the foot in Indy or Tampa Bay.
I think the NFC is pretty wide open.
The Packers, Saints, Bucs, Rams and Seahawks have all shown the ability to get hot and go on a run.
All those teams have looked like the best team in the conference at some point this season.
Good morning mike!
While I won't have an issue because I have NFL Network, is there a live stream of the Wayne and Larry radio broadcast?
I believe there are ways to find that, yes.
Every week we post an item on our site with all the various streaming options.
I'd suggest checking out the info in there.
Seems like Tampa would have the upper hand if we are tied.
But only if Tampa wins the NFC South.
If the Bucs are a wild-card, they will be seeded lower than the Packers no matter what.
Hi Mike.
I don't remember much about ﻿Brian Price﻿.
What are your recollections of him?
I remember a nice guy who was fun to talk to, and a pretty active D-lineman who could do some things in a limited role.
He's not going to play 40 snaps a game or anything at this point, but he can help in the rotation if they activate him.
How is the forecast for Saturday looking?
Chilly but nothing crazy from what I've heard.
But it's only Wednesday.
Do you think we will see some of ﻿AJ Dillon﻿ this week?
Having him really fresh for the run might come in handy.
I have no idea how Dillon is doing after his long stint on the Covid list.
I'm sure they're working him back in slowly.
That was a long layoff.
Doesn't it kind of blow your mind to see the offensive stats the Pack is putting up and still seeing so much left out there on the field every week on dropped passes?
If a few players had better hands this team would be out of the NFL average stratosphere!
I mean ﻿Aaron Rodgers﻿ is still completing almost 70%?!
?
There haven't been a lot of drops lately.
The one deep ball vs. Philly, but other than that, the last 3 games if I recall correctly the receivers have caught just about everything.
Is a big return as demoralizing to the defense as it appears to be?
I think those can be demoralizing to the whole team, but it's on the defense to go out and thwart the momentum, which the Packers did to hold the Lions to a FG late in that game.
Those are big moments.
I know the defense has had its struggles at times, but it has risen up at some key junctures too.
You should expect 3,500+ readers on Saturday's Blog...
It would be awesome to hit a number like that.
It would be a new record, for sure.
Here in Connecticut, Packer fans whose cable package doe not include NFL Network are concerned they can't see the game against Panthers (limited bar options due to COVID, etc.).
I saw the recent streaming options article in the app, but can we be certain the game will be viewable in the app on mobile devices?
Cross your fingers, I guess.
It's not something we directly control, but it is supposed to be available.
I think the caveat, though, is you can't stream it on WiFi.
You have to stream it on cellular/data, which can be costly depending on your service plan.
Good Morning Mike, do you think there could be a chance we see all 3 ILB's during the Tennessee game?
I know that someone had mentioned all 3 played last game.
Wondering if we are in any sort of preparation for that heavy hitter.
On the field at the same time?
I doubt it.
I can't recall seeing a package like that, and it would be a big departure to put something like that in during December.
The Cowboys have been heard complaining about the "incompetence" of the coaching staff.
Saying they are unprepared and have poor game planning.
Is this just frustration speaking or has Mike McCarthy really lost his ability?
When teams don't win, people get frustrated.
It's been a rough year in Dallas, but it sounds like they're going to give McCarthy the opportunity to turn things around.
I expect him to be up to the challenge, but his surrounding cast will matter, too.
Mike, ﻿Marquez Valdes-Scantling﻿ is looking like our #2 WR.
Do you see his development similar to ﻿Davante Adams﻿?
Fans were hard on Davante early in his career.
I don't think they're anything alike, to be honest.
They're different receivers who have had different struggles.
What's the same is the Packers believe in both players, and they've both gotten the opportunity needed to prove who they are.
What are your plans for Sunday, Mike?
Getting some sleep after a long night of work, first of all.
After that, I'm sure I'll try to catch as much of Bears-Vikings and Chiefs-Saints as possible.
Glad I could finally make it on here live this year!
Do you think that ﻿Tavon Austin﻿ will see more snaps on Sat?
I do.
LaFleur somewhat regretted not using him more this past Sunday, but game flow can go that way with regard to plans for new players.
I think his workload will increase as long as he keeps producing.
In your mind, does Rodgers have a better chance to win MVP if He somehow finds another level these three games or Mahomes has another bad game possible losing one that he's played poorly in?
If both keep doing what they're doing, I think it's going to be a really close vote.
Mahomes has a big matchup against that New Orleans defense this week.
Rodgers has three cold-weather games coming up that will make things harder in the passing game.
We'll just have to see how it plays out.
Mike....I just want to add my thanks for your game day blogs.
For us displaced cheeseheads who would rather not go to sports bars to catch the games during the COVID mess, they are super helpful in following what's going on.
Thanks for your participation.
It's challenging but fun at the same time.
Hi Mike - It's looking like McCaffrey is not expected to play this weekend...
Without him on the field, what is the toughest matchup for the Packers defense?
And do you see this being more of a pass heavy or run heavy game for the Packers offense?
If the Panthers get DJ Moore back as a top target for Bridgewater, that'll be key.
Moore is a big-play guy.
On the other side, I think the Packers will want to stay as balanced as they can, and the weather could factor into things.
The Panthers aren't particularly great or bad defensively in any one aspect.
They don't have a lot of sacks.
That might be their biggest weakness.
What is the on-side kick return "hands" team SUPPOSED to do on that play?
I can't imagine they are coached to all stand there with the opposing players waiting to see if the ball goes 10 yards and then see who pounces on the ball first.
If it doesn't look like the ball will go 10 yards, they are instructed not to try to recover it, where a muff would make it a live ball.
The kicks that are right on the edge whether or not it looks like they'll go 10 yards are tough ones.
But I wouldn't want my guys trying to jump on the ball at 7 yards if it's sideways path would suggest it's not going 10 yards.
Mike - I think people don't realize ﻿Robert Tonyan﻿ is a restricted free agent after the season.
In your mind is he someone the Packers are looking to lock up long term?
Potentially, but with RFAs you have tender offers and other procedures that can buy time to work out a long-term deal.
The MVP race might come down to which teams are still fighting for seeding and which rest their players.
Chiefs could clinch the bye with a win and a Steelers loss I believe.
Chiefs need a win plus a Steelers loss and a Bills loss to clinch the 1 seed in the AFC this week.
But yeah, if things get clinched and one team or another decides to sit players, it might factor in stats-wise, but I don't think the voters would punish someone for not playing when it's not necessary.
Hey Mike!
I understand personnel changes constantly but are there any glaring changes to the ways this Panther's team plays systematically compared to the Kyle Allen led team that almost beat us last year?
They have a new head coach in Matt Rhule who has overhauled a lot of things.
I don't think they're very similar at all.
To tie this to the Packers, do you think Aaron Rodgers is a very happy minority Milwaukee Bucks owner with the Supermax news from yesterday?
Absolutely.
Hi Mike, thanks for the chat as always!
From the perspective of your preseason self, what's been the biggest surprise to you thus far?
Just how well this offense clicked from the get-go in Week 1, when there wasn't an on-field offseason (OTAs, minicamps, etc.).
They had a few weeks in training camp to put it all together and they hit the ground running.
I see all the online chatter about the Packers playing consistently with one of the "lightest" defensive boxes in the NFL.
I think if you have AR and a highly efficient offenses, why not play the percentages?
Are you aware of any metrics the defensive coaches rely on in determining the relative success of their "light" boxes against the run?
They chart everything and know their successes and failures of certain packages against what offenses do.
But game plans are more opponent-specific than anything.
Figure out how you're going to limit what your opponent does best and build a plan from there.
With the Packers defense at 8th in total yards allowed and 19th in points allowed (not surprising with our offensive dominance).
Is the concerns with the defense mainly with the inconsistency?
For sure.
This defense has shown at times it can make plays that change games.
It also has frustrating letdowns.
Last week it was the screen passes on one drive and the penalties on another.
It's hard to play strong defense for 4 quarters in today's NFL.
Offenses are good and the rules make it tough.
But this Packers unit has been up and down pretty much all year.
As I said before, when they rise up in big moments, the offense has to take advantage, and it usually does.

Hey Mike, Is it just me or is Wes really feeling his oats lately?
He's put together some pretty sassy Inboxes.
Late season push?
Even with a lot of victories, seasons can get long on all of us.
Wes is fine.
He just takes it out on the Inbox sometimes instead of me, which I appreciate.
I have to agree with Ferd.
They could at least attempt getting the ball but with momentum going out of bounds so the ball goes out of play.
That would be one strategy when the ball gets near the sideline, yes.
Out of the upcoming free agents... who do you see as odd man out?
Money will be VERY tight this offseason.
No idea, and it's not something I focus on when this team is in the position it's currently in.
There's a long offseason to worry about all of that.
Mike, any word yet on ﻿Rashan Gary﻿'s status for the game Saturday?
He was listed as limited on the estimated injury report yesterday, with a hip injury.
That's a good sign, meaning if the Packers had conducted a practice, he wouldn't have been held out entirely.
Do you think teams will have a lot more turnover this off-season as every team scrambles to get under the cap?
Potentially, yes.
Mike, what is the rule on allowing enough space for a returner making a fair catch?
Is an actual distance mentioned in the official wording?
It just seems like defenses are getting up close and personal way more than I'm used to seeing.
It's been pretty much the same as always from what I've observed.
Thanks Mike, Who has improved the most on defense this year?
Gary, ﻿Darnell Savage﻿.
﻿Dean Lowry﻿ has come on strong lately.
﻿Krys Barnes﻿ and ﻿Kamal Martin﻿ are definitely showing they belong.
I think Vernon Scott has a future, too.
I know Tonyan looks like what we had been expecting from Graham the past two years, but seeing that Graham has about the same numbers with the Bears this year as we are getting from Big Bob, are the Bears doing something different with Graham than we did?
I don't watch the Bears all the time, but I've said before I think Graham has just caught the ball better on those red-zone targets than he did here.
The Packers gave him a ton of chances and plays weren't made as frequently.
You look at his receptions compared to total targets when he was here and the efficiency wasn't good.
To follow up on the question/comment in II today about how it is unrealistic to expect any defense to dominate in the NFL these days, it seems to me that in each possession you might get them in 3rd and long (7+) yards once.
You have to get them to 4th down in those cases, It seems like the Packers were better at that last year than this.
For instance, once the Lions converted that 3rd and 9 on their first drive a TD seemed almost inevitable.
If my premise is correct about the deficiency this year versus last what do you think is the cause?
Your premise is right.
When you get a third-and-long, the defense has to get off the field.
Statistically over the full season, the Packers are one of the best defenses in the league in third-and-7-plus.
The early third-and-9 in Detroit led to a TD, and the only third down after that on the opening drive was third-and-2.
They gave up some third-and-longs at Indy.
But overall, they've been good there and haven't had as many letdowns as other teams.
Mike, what's your take on ﻿Aaron Jones﻿ hiring a new agent?
I mentioned in Inbox this morning that one read on it is he might be wanting to get something done with the Packers sooner than later, and when it wasn't getting done, he switched things up.
If he were determined to test the market in March, there would have been no rush to hire a new agent.
But I don't want to speak for him.
I might be missing something in the equation.
A lot has been made about home field advantage not being such an advantage this year due to the absence of fans.
Going out on a limb, but perhaps our D can capitalize on the cold weather and we can start the early production on some FroZa' Tundra T-shirts....
I know the crowds won't be involved, but I still think the Packers playing at home in January would be to their benefit.
Teams like the Bucs, Saints, Rams don't play in that kind of weather and the Packers do.
Green Bay might not put up 35 offensively in the cold, but the negatives for other teams might be more.
In the MVP race do voters only take into account official passing stats or do they take into account less measurable attributes?
Like would they consider Rodgers ability to get free plays on hard counts or noticing 12 defensive men on the field or even just getting into a better play based on the defensive alignment?
Every voter has his/her own interpretation of what the award means and what stats and attributes matter most.
There are 50 voters, so there can be all sorts of opinions.
Comparing dollars paid to TDs scored you'd you say that Tonyan is the best value on our team?
That's one way to look at it.
Aaron Jones was one heck of a bargain last year in that regard, no?
With Barnes and Martin coming on, do you think they become the primary ILBs this season at some point?
Perhaps.
I wouldn't rule anything out, but we'll just have to see.
I still expect all three of those guys to get snaps, but their workloads could continue to adjust.
Does Pettine truly prefer the third safety over the second inside linebacker or is it all based on the talent at those positions?
It's based on the player available and what he gives the defense.
It's also dependent on the personnel groups the opposing offense is using in certain situations.
I just received a Kringle delivery (I live in Idaho) from my family in WI.
Now, a Packers win on Saturday will complete a near perfect week.
Aw, that sounds really good.
It's almost time to check the fridge today, too.
When I think of homefield advantage at Lambeau, I always seem to recall SF and Atlanta coming in and winning at Lambeau.
Was it purely difference in overall talent during those games?
Pretty much, yeah.
Michael Vick was at the top of his game when Atlanta won here in the playoffs, and that SF team was in the middle of a heck of a run.
Home-field advantage isn't everything, but I still think it's better for the Packers to play here in January than elsewhere.
Is the Packers organization doing a holiday event for staff this year?
Lots of employers trying virtual parties and I'm imagining such an event at Lambeau this year.
No, the annual holiday party has been called off, as expected.
The organization is giving all the employees a gift of some sort of meat box, though, which should be nice.
Everybody gets to pick theirs up today or tomorrow.
Just a hardy thanks for all you Wes and Larry do to keep us entertained!
Enjoy you all tremendously!
And we appreciate your loyalty and readership/viewership.
Sorry folks, but I have to run now.
Talk again soon, and enjoy the game Saturday night.
Best, Mike

Marcus Spears advises the Packers to consider the future regarding Aaron Rodgers.
(1:06)
GREEN BAY, Wis. -- If you thought the Green Bay Packers faced a challenge with the salary cap this year, wait until you see what they’re up against in 2022.
Combine that with the fact the Packers haven’t made a single adjustment to Aaron Rodgers' contract, and the 2021 season might be lining up as their last, best chance at another Super Bowl run before they turn things over to Jordan Love or whichever quarterback will succeed Rodgers.
Consider that the Packers had to rework the contracts of Adrian Amos, David Bakhtiari, Mason Crosby, Preston Smith, Za'Darius Smith and Billy Turner just to be able to re-sign Aaron Jones, Kevin King and Marcedes Lewis without adding a single unrestricted free agent from another team (and no, street free agent long-snapper Joe Fortunato doesn’t count).
The Packers, as it stands now, have 20 of their 22 preferred starters from last season’s 13-3 NFC Championship Game team back for what feels like one more try with this group.
That could be what general manager Brian Gutekunst meant when he made this statement shortly before the Packers began restructuring deals to get under the salary cap last month:
“We’re going to do that this year quite a bit, push money out to give us our best chance to win in ’21,” Gutekunst said.
“There’s a lot of avenues to do it, but at the same time, we have a really good football team.
I think the core of our football team is going to be really strong the next few years, and we want to give ourselves every chance to compete for championships within that time.”
All but Preston Smith were simple restructures, meaning they pushed money into future salary-cap years.
Preston Smith was the only one who took a 2021 pay cut.
The top eight players under contract for next season have a combined 2022 salary-cap charge of $161.14 million.
If the salary cap jumps from $182.5 million this season to, say, $200 million next season, it still would mean the Packers have more than 80% of their cap tied up in those eight players.
PlayerCap Number for 2022Aaron Rodgers$39.852 millionZa'Darius Smith$28.130 millionDavid Bakhtiari$22.786 millionKenny Clark$20.65 millionPreston Smith$19.75 millionAdrian Amos$11.982 millionAaron Jones$9 millionBilly Turner$8.99 millionTotal:$161.14 millionIf the cap jumped to, say, $220 million because of the new TV money kicking in (although some believe that won’t factor in until 2023), then those eight players still would count for 73.2% of the 2022 cap.Currently, the Packers’ top eight players for this season account for $109.13 million in cap space, or 59.8% of the 2021 cap, not counting space carried over from the previous season.The Packers already have $204.192 million in committed cap space for 2022, and that's without All-Pros Davante Adams and Jaire Alexander.
Adams is entering the final year of his contract, and there's no chance the Packers let him walk.
Alexander could be back on the fifth-year option, which the Packers have to exercise by May 3.
The option on Alexander will cost the Packers nearly $13.3 million for 2022.Whatever the cap number for 2022 is, the Packers can’t operate with so little space left for the rest of the roster.Za’Darius Smith’s restructure set him up for an extension before next season if he continues to perform at the same level, and the Packers could move on from Preston Smith and save $12.225 million in cap space if he continues his decline in 2021.“Every year is different,” Gutekunst said.
“There’s so much you can’t predict.
There’s so many variables that I think you have to try to build a sound, robust, all-around football team that can take on whatever challenges come your way.”Still, it all begs the question: Why haven’t they touched Rodgers’ contract?
Packers President Mark Murphy wouldn't say Monday.Considering their cap situation, how can the Packers keep both Aaron Rodgers and David Bakhtiari in 2020?
Jonathan Daniel/Getty ImagesDoing so would essentially force them to commit to him beyond 2021.
Perhaps they want to see how Love performs this summer in a full training camp and in preseason games, assuming there are any, before they make a decision on Rodgers' deal.
They did not convert his $6.8 million roster bonus into a signing bonus when they had the chance in March.
That would have given them $4.5 million in additional cap space for this season but also would have increased his cap number for next year.They still could turn some of his $14.7 million base salary for this season into a signing bonus, which would push his 2022 cap charge into the $45 million range.As the contract stands now, the Packers would gain between $22 million and $25 million in cap space for 2022 if they moved on from Rodgers after this season.It’s also possible Rodgers would want to go the Tom Brady route and try to win another Super Bowl elsewhere before he retires.“You're talking about the guy that's going to win the MVP of the league,” Packers coach Matt LaFleur said shortly before Rodgers won the third MVP of his career.
“We're not in this position without him.
I couldn't be happier with just not only his performance but how he led our football team, all the little things he does within that locker room to ensure that everybody is locked in, focused and ready to go.
Absolutely he will be here for a long time.
I know I've said that before, but a long time."
If the cap jumped to, say, $220 million because of the new TV money kicking in (although some believe that won’t factor in until 2023), then those eight players still would count for 73.2% of the 2022 cap.
Currently, the Packers’ top eight players for this season account for $109.13 million in cap space, or 59.8% of the 2021 cap, not counting space carried over from the previous season.
The Packers already have $204.192 million in committed cap space for 2022, and that's without All-Pros Davante Adams and Jaire Alexander.
Adams is entering the final year of his contract, and there's no chance the Packers let him walk.
Alexander could be back on the fifth-year option, which the Packers have to exercise by May 3.

Doing so would essentially force them to commit to him beyond 2021.
Perhaps they want to see how Love performs this summer in a full training camp and in preseason games, assuming there are any, before they make a decision on Rodgers' deal.
They did not convert his $6.8 million roster bonus into a signing bonus when they had the chance in March.
That would have given them $4.5 million in additional cap space for this season but also would have increased his cap number for next year.
They still could turn some of his $14.7 million base salary for this season into a signing bonus, which would push his 2022 cap charge into the $45 million range.
As the contract stands now, the Packers would gain between $22 million and $25 million in cap space for 2022 if they moved on from Rodgers after this season.
It’s also possible Rodgers would want to go the Tom Brady route and try to win another Super Bowl elsewhere before he retires.
“You're talking about the guy that's going to win the MVP of the league,” Packers coach Matt LaFleur said shortly before Rodgers won the third MVP of his career.
“We're not in this position without him.
I couldn't be happier with just not only his performance but how he led our football team, all the little things he does within that locker room to ensure that everybody is locked in, focused and ready to go.
Absolutely he will be here for a long time.
I know I've said that before, but a long time."

GREEN BAY – ﻿Corey Linsley﻿ can't predict the future and certainly isn't going to try.
However, the Packers' veteran center has played enough football to understand what the conclusion of the 2020 NFL season could mean for his own career.
The All-Pro center, who has started all 110 games (including playoffs) he's played for Green Bay, is facing free agency for the first time in seven NFL seasons, after previously signing a three-year extension days before the 2017 regular-season finale.
As the clock hit zero on Sunday's NFC Championship Game against Tampa Bay, Linsley briefly paused to watch the final kneel-down from the South end zone of Lambeau Field before running up the tunnel towards an uncertain offseason.
"It's a lot of emotions going on," said Linsley on Monday.
"I feel like I put out some good film and did the best that I could this year.
… There's not much to put behind it right now just because with the game and everything, it's the offseason, a lot of it's out of my control.
I did what I could this year.
That's kind of it."
Linsley is one of 13 Packers players set to hit the open market in March, a list that includes running backs ﻿Aaron Jones﻿ and ﻿Jamaal Williams﻿, and cornerback ﻿Kevin King﻿.
The 29-year-old center had arguably his best season in 2020, playing 734 offensive snaps over 13 regular-season starts (including playoffs) for the league's highest-scoring offense.
Still, Sunday's 31-26 loss to the Buccaneers was a bittersweet way for Linsley's season to draw to a close.
Not only because of the outcome but also the fact he was unable to share the field with ﻿David Bakhtiari﻿ after the five-time All-Pro left tackle sustained a season-ending knee injury last month in practice.
"We wanted to win a Super Bowl together.
We had talked about it and dreamed about it together," said Linsley, the sixth-longest tenured player on the Packers' roster.
"For him, knowing that he wasn't going to physically be a part of that, it hurt me a lot and it sucked.
"But if there's one guy that I would be pick to recover from this and make a full recovery and be better, it's Dave, for sure.
I know he's going to be all right but it was tough."
Linsley handled his own share of adversity in 2020.
He battled a back injury early in the season before seeing his consecutive starts streak end at 68 regular-season games due to a knee injury that sidelined him for three December starts.
Yet, Linsley bounced back to finish the season on a high note.
While he wasn't selected to the Pro Bowl, Linsley received 18 first-place votes en route to becoming the first Packers center to be named first team All-Pro by the Associated Press since Pro Football Hall of Famer Jim Ringo in 1963.
In the aftermath of the Pro Bowl snub, Bakhtiari and quarterback ﻿Aaron Rodgers﻿ were two of Linsley's most adamant supporters in the lead-up to the All-Pro announcement.
"I know it meant a lot to him.
How can it not?
To be able to be recognized like that with All-Pro," said Rodgers earlier this month.
"I mean Pro Bowl is a great recognition as well but there's a big camp – led by David Bakhtiari – who believe that All-Pro might be more important.
… I was just so excited for him to be given that honor.
I know how much it means to him, you know he's in a contract year and everything, and that's important.
But just knowing him and his lovely wife, Ana, he's just a really good person."
A fifth-round pick in 2014, Linsley has become a valued veteran presence in the locker room.
This past spring, he was an instrumental part of the team's social-justice initiatives.
Linsley also was honored for his longstanding partnership with CASA of Brown County when his teammates voted him as the Packers' nominee for the Walter Payton Man of the Year.
The winner of the award will be announced during the NFL Honors ceremony the night before Super Bowl LV.
Although there are a lot of unknowns right now, Linsley looks back on the last seven years fondly.
He's enjoyed building a friendship with Rodgers that goes beyond the football field.
He cherishes the time spent with his two primary offensive line coaches, James Campen and Adam Stenavich, and appreciates all the laughs he's shared inside the Packers' locker room – many of which came courtesy of Bakhtiari.
"Just the funny stuff that happens day to day, half of it you can't share and the other half you don't want to.
That's what I'm going to remember," said Linsley with a smile.
"The wins in football and all that, it's great, and it's bittersweet because we didn't get where we wanted to go.
But the best times are just hanging out with the guys and laughing."

GREEN BAY – The Packers advanced to their second straight NFC Championship Game with a 32-18 victory on Saturday over the Rams in the divisional round at Lambeau Field.
The Packers led by seven in the fourth quarter when QB Aaron Rodgers found WR Allen Lazard﻿, who had dropped a potentially big play earlier in the second half, for a 58-yard touchdown to give Green Bay a two-score lead again.
The defense then responded with a tackle for loss and sack on a Rams series near midfield to get the ball back and keep the Packers in command.
The Packers are back in the NFC title game and will face the winner of Sunday's Buccaneers-Saints game.
Next week's game will be at 2:05 p.m. CT at Lambeau Field.
Lazard finished with four catches for 96 yards and the TD, while WR Davante Adams had nine catches for 66 yards and a score.
Rodgers finished 23-of-36 for 296 yards with two TDs and no interceptions for a 108.1 passer rating.
The Packers' ground game was productive all game, with RB Aaron Jones getting 99 yards and a TD on 14 carries.
RB Jamaal Williams added 65 yards on 12 attempts.
For the Rams, QB Jared Goff was 21-of-27 for 174 yards and a TD for a 105.9 rating.
RB Cam Akers had 18 rushes for 90 yards and a TD, while no one for LA had more than 65 receiving yards.
Here's a recap of all the action:
The Packers won the opening coin toss and deferred.
The Rams went three-and-out to start the game with ﻿Preston Smith﻿ deflecting a Jared Goff at the line of scrimmage on third-and-6.
Green Bay motioned ﻿Davante Adams﻿ cross pre-snap on second-and-8, as the Rams opted to leave All-Pro cornerback Jalen Ramsey on the defense's left.
Quarterback ﻿Aaron Rodgers﻿ hit Adams a quick out for 8 yards and the initial first down.
Green Bay also used a two-RB package of ﻿Aaron Jones﻿ and ﻿AJ Dillon﻿ on the opening possession, with Dillon picking up nine yards up the middle after Jones motioned wide.
The biggest play of the drive came when Rodgers caught the Rams trying to substitute after a 3-yard run by Dillon, finding ﻿Equanimeous St. Brown﻿ for 27 in the middle of the field on the free down.
The Packers' drive stalled at the LA 5, as Green Bay had to settle for a 24-yard field goal by Mason Crosby to give the Packers an early 3-0 lead.
Los Angeles answered back by going hurry-up against the Packers' base defense, with Goff completing passes down the middle to Robert Woods (19 yards) and Josh Reynolds (28) to get down to the Green Bay 23.
The Rams tried to go with a Wildcat package with Cam Akers at quarterback but linebacker ﻿Christian Kirksey﻿ sniffed it out to hold Los Angeles' running back to a 2-yard gain on first-and-10.
The Packers' dime defense stopped Akers on third-and-2 at the Green Bay 15.
The Rams tried to go for it on fourth-and-1 but a false start penalty caused them to settle for a Matt Gay 37-yard field goal to tie the game at 3 with 4 minutes, 36 seconds left in the first quarter.
The Packers advanced back into Rams territory at the end of the first quarter thanks to three runs by ﻿Jamaal Williams﻿ for 17 yards and two passes to ﻿Robert Tonyan﻿ for 14.
The second quarter began with Aaron Donald being flagged for unnecessary roughness after putting his hands on ﻿Elgton Jenkins﻿' facemask after an incomplete pass to Adams.
Instead of third-and-7 at the LA 36, the Packers used the first-and-10 situation at the 21 to set up two runs by Jones for nine yards, an 8-yard pass to ﻿Allen Lazard﻿ to set up first-and-goal and Williams plowing through for 5 yards down to the LA 1.
Facing third-and-goal, Green Bay motioned Adams across with Ramsey following him.
Adams then pivoted and motioned back to the right and Rodgers hit him on a quick flare for the 1-yard TD to take a 10-3 lead.
With the catch, Adams moved into sole possession of the No.
2 spot in team playoff history with seven receiving TDs.
Freeman had 10 and Jennings had six.
Rodgers moved past Peyton Manning (40) on the all-time postseason list and now ranks No.
4 in NFL history with 41.
The Packers' defense came right back with another stand.
After holding Akers to a 3-yard run on a stretch play, ﻿Za'Darius Smith﻿ came inside a ﻿Christian Kirksey﻿ blitz to sack Goff for a 7-yard loss on second down.
Kirksey then dropped Malcolm Brown on a 4-yard check down on third-and-14 to force the Rams to another three-and-out.
The Packers started their next series at the LA 47 after a special-teams penalty on the Rams.
Rodgers started the drive with a check down to Jones for 14 yards after he turned upfield and made Troy Hill miss.
Green Bay moved back inside the Rams' 20 after two throws to Valdes-Scantling for 17 yards.
Jones nearly broke a big gain off the left side but Tonyan was flagged for holding.
The Packers countered back with a 12-yard slant to Adams to set up third-and-2, which Williams converted on a 5-yard dive up the middle.
Two more Williams carries for six yards setup third-and-goal at the LA 2.
Rodgers scrambled in for the 2-yard TD on a read option, extending Green Bay's lead to 16-3 after an aborted extra point in which ﻿Mason Crosby﻿ was banged up.
Mike linebacker ﻿Krys Barnes﻿ left the game momentarily with a thumb injury but returned with a club.
The Rams mounted a late drive, cutting the Packers' lead to 16-10 after a nine-play, 75-yard drive that ended with a 10-yard TD pass to Van Jefferson.
The Packers got the ball back with 29 seconds left and two timeouts.
Rodgers connected with Adams for 21 and Tonyan for 33 to set up Crosby's 39-yard field goal to give Green Bay a 19-10 lead at halftime.
The Packers chipped away at the Rams' defense in the first half, carrying it 15 times for 66 yards, before ﻿Aaron Jones﻿ broke a 60-yard run to open the third quarter.
It's the third longest run by a Packers player in playoff history.
Green Bay would keep it on the ground during the five-play, 54-yard series with Jones eventually punching it in with a 1-yard TD run up the middle to put the Packers ahead 25-10 after the failed two-point conversion.
Green Bay forced its third three-and-out of the Rams' offense with Akers being limited to three yards on first down, ﻿Za'Darius Smith﻿ pressuring Goff into throwing the ball away on second-and-7, and ﻿Rashan Gary﻿ and ﻿Kenny Clark﻿ combining on a sack for a 9-yard loss.
The Packers were facing second-and-17 from their own 7 when Rodgers stood tall in the pocket and connected with Lazard for 21 yards and the first down.
Lazard had another chance for a big play on first down after a 11-yard Williams run, but he couldn't bring it in and Green Bay would have to punt for the first time.
The Rams came out slinging the ball, completing six straight passes to move into scoring range.
The Packers did a good job of stifling LA's Wildcat formation with Akers on its first two tries but the rookie running back finally found paydirt on a 7-yard run up the middle.
The Rams cut the Packers' lead to one score after hook-and-lateral pass to Akers, bringing the score to 25-18 with 1:41 remaining in the third quarter.
The third quarter ended with Rodgers connecting with Adams on a 8-yard pass off a slant to the Green Bay 47.
The Packers' drive stalled two minutes into the fourth quarter, with ﻿KeiVarae Russell﻿ downing ﻿JK Scott﻿'s punt at the LA 6.
A series of short throws moved the ball out to the Rams' 32 before an incompletion and a Clark sack for a 6-yard loss made it third-and-16.
Goff had to settle for a 5-yard completion, leading to a Johnny Hekker punt.
On second-and-6, Rodgers dialed up a 58-yard touchdown pass to Lazard deep down the seam to push their lead to 32-18 with 7 minutes remaining.
The Packers' defense took it from there, with Jaire Alexander tackling Woods for a 3-yard loss on a second-and-10 screen and Preston Smith deflecting his second pass of the day on third down.
The Rams went for it on fourth-and-13 but Clark and Gary combined for another sack of Goff for the turnover on downs at the LA 49.
Rodgers hit Tonyan on a playaction rollout for a first down to start draining the clock.
Back-to-back carries of six yards for Williams resulted in a second first down, drawing a fist pump out of Rodgers with 2:35 remaining.
One more WIlliams first down brought the game to the two-minute warning, allowing Rodgers to kneel out the win.

Following today's approval from NFL clubs at a virtual league meeting, the enhanced NFL season schedule which will feature each team playing 17 regular-season games and three preseason games will go into effect in 2021.
The new scheduling format will see each team host 10 games overall – either nine regular-season games and one preseason game or eight regular-season games and two preseason games.
Moving to 17 regular-season games will provide fans an extra week of regular-season NFL action, with the additional matchup featuring teams from opposing conferences that finished in the same place within their division in the previous season.
The AFC was determined to host the additional game in 2021, and with the NFC North matching up with the AFC West, the Packers will face the Kansas City Chiefs this coming season in Kansas City.
Because Lambeau Field will not host an additional game this season, both Gold and Green package Season Ticket Holders will receive their regular allotment of games this year.
While Green package invoices are not affected, Gold package invoices will be updated accordingly on ticket holders' online accounts to reflect that no additional game will take place at Lambeau Field this year.
Gold package Season Ticket Holders who have already paid their invoices for this season will soon receive a refund of the difference between the cost of the regular-season and preseason game.
Those who haven't yet paid their invoices will be able to pay the updated invoice on their online account.
Any Gold package Season Ticket Holder who received the invoice in the mail and was planning to mail in their payment can pay the adjusted amount due: end zone seats are $58 for preseason, $118 for regular season; south end zone, 700 Level are $61 for preseason, $121 for regular season; south end zone, 600 Level are $64 for preseason, $129 for regular season; end zone to the 20-yard line are $69 for preseason, $134 for regular season; between the 20-yard lines are $74 for preseason, $149 for regular season.
Additionally, updated invoices will be mailed to Gold package Season Ticket Holders who have not yet paid their invoices.
The official 2021 schedule, with playing dates and times, will be announced later this spring.
With the additional regular-season game, Super Bowl LVI at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles will take place on Sunday, Feb. 13, 2022.
Additionally, with the new 17-game format, the NFL is expanding their efforts to grow the game internationally, and the Packers will be a part of this effort.
The process of scheduling teams to play games internationally has now been formalized and starting in 2022, the Packers will be included in the regular rotation to play internationally, which will focus initially on Canada, Europe, Mexico, South America and the United Kingdom.
While the Packers will not be required to give up one of the traditional eight regular season home games hosted at Lambeau Field, a Packers-hosted game may be played at an international site in years when the NFC hosts nine home games.
This would only occur once every eight years; the Packers would play eight regular-season home games and one preseason game at Lambeau Field, and one regular-season game at a neutral, international site.
The Packers may play additional international games as the visiting team.
Lambeau Field premium seat ticket prices are set per client contracts.
Those who have any questions regarding their contract can call (920) 569-7260.

Murphy Takes 5 is a monthly column written by President and CEO Mark Murphy

GREEN BAY, Wis. -- Green Bay Packers president Mark Murphy had a chance to diffuse what has again become a brewing situation with quarterback Aaron Rodgers.
But unlike in the immediate aftermath of the season after Rodgers openly questioned his future in Green Bay and Murphy quickly tried to put that narrative to rest, Tuesday’s non-answers reopened the speculation about the reigning NFL MVP’s future with the Packers.
Murphy, who acts as the team owner, refused to say why the team has not restructured or extended Rodgers' contract.
The Packers restructured the contracts of six different players this offseason to create much-needed salary-cap space both to get under the cap and also re-sign free agents such as Aaron Jones and Kevin King.
But they didn’t touch Rodgers’ deal.
“I can’t really get into specific players,” Murphy said.
“We’ve been able to create room with others.”
When asked why he wouldn’t want to do something to ensure Rodgers is the Packers’ quarterback beyond just this season, Murphy said: “Yeah, I’m not going to get [into] the specifics again.
Good try, though.”
Rodgers is under contract through the 2023 season, but his future has been in question ever since general manager Brian Gutekunst drafted QB Jordan Love in the first round last year.
Rodgers called his future a “beautiful mystery” during the week leading up to the NFC Championship Game and then after the title game loss to the Buccaneers included himself in the group of players with uncertain futures in Green Bay.
Best of NFL Nation• Tackling issues for big Lamar contract• 49ers take advantage of tough market• How does Drake fit with Jacobs, Raiders?
• Pats could find QB depth after first round • Can Bears ever break vicious QB cycle?Shortly thereafter, Murphy told Green Bay radio station WNFL: “There’s no way in heck Aaron is not going to be on the Packers ... we’re not idiots.”Although both Gutekunst and coach Matt LaFleur also have said publicly that they see Rodgers in Green Bay both in 2021 and beyond, that they’ve left his contract untouched means they could move on after this season and pick up between $22 million and $25 million in salary-cap space.
Those familiar with Rodgers' thinking believe he wants assurances that he's not a lame-duck quarterback in 2021.The Packers could have done that by adjusting his contract.
Instead, they passed on the chance to convert his March roster bonus of $6.8 million into a signing bonus, which would have pushed cap charges into future years and therefore created more dead money if they moved on.Murphy, who became the Packers’ president shortly before the 2008 split with Brett Favre, also would not say whether he’s concerned if there’s an issue developing between the organization and Rodgers.“Again, I'm not going to get into any individual player or any issues along those lines,” Murphy said.Perhaps the questions caught Murphy off guard considering he was on a Zoom call to discuss Tuesday’s NFL owners meetings in which the league voted to expand the regular season to 17 games, but Murphy was given three different chances to address the Rodgers situation and he did not.Whatever the reason, it ensured that this storyline will have legs throughout the offseason.

On the first Saturday of every month, Mark will write about a topic of interest to Packers fans and the organization, and then answer five fan questions.
Fans are encouraged to email Mark with their name and hometown at: MurphyTakes5@packers.com.
I'm often asked by people what I do in the offseason.
I think most fans would be surprised to learn how much NFL teams do in the offseason, especially in February and March (which most people assume is a slow period of time for teams).
Now, I'm not saying that we're as busy as we are during the season, but there is a lot going on.
This is particularly true this offseason, with the salary cap going down.
Immediately following the end of the season is typically the time that teams will make coaching changes.
This time period was very busy for us this year, with Matt LaFleur's decision to make changes at both defensive and special teams coordinator.
I give Matt tremendous credit for his willingness to make these changes, even though we have had two straight successful seasons.
The better head coaches are always looking for ways to improve their coaching staffs and the team generally.
We ended up interviewing numerous candidates before hiring Joe Barry as our defensive coordinator, and promoting Maurice Drayton to special teams coordinator.
For the 2020 season, the salary cap was $198.2 million.
Right now, all we know about the cap for this year is that it will be no lower than $180 million.
We started the offseason $32.5 million over the salary cap.
We've made a number of moves (e.g.
releasing players, restructuring players' contracts) to reduce our salary costs.
We still have a ways to go before our preseason roster will be set, and these are very difficult decisions.
We have a number of players who are free agents that we would like to keep, but that will require freeing up more cap space.
We are very fortunate to have someone like Russ Ball who is so skilled at managing our salary cap.
February is also a busy time in terms of our budget process for the entire organization.
Finally, league committee meetings take a lot of time during February and March as we are getting ready for the league's annual meeting at the end of March.
Mid-June to mid-July is typically the time when most of our football employees will take their vacations.
Now, on to your questions…
Greg from Toluca, IL
Hello Mr. Murphy, first off, a compliment to the organization for the way the season was handled.
Safety – foremost important, but then toward the end allowing employees their families AND first responders to attend...first rate.
My question is about the situation for season ticket holders.
We paid for our tickets last year and COVID kept us home.
What can we expect for the upcoming season as to any price increase?
Should we be looking for an invoice for a balance due?
Thank you, I appreciate all the good work you folks are doing!
Thanks, Greg.
I appreciate your kind words.
It was a challenging year in many ways, and I'm proud of the way we handled it as an organization.
With regard to your question, next week we will be sending out a letter to all season ticket holders explaining this year's ticket situation.
The situation is complicated by the expected move to 17 regular-season games.
If we have nine regular-season home games (it has not been determined yet whether the NFC or AFC teams will have the extra home game this year), we will select either the Gold or Green package ticket holders to have the extra game (then the other package would get the extra regular-season game the next time the NFC has the additional regular-season game, two years later).
When the Green or Gold package ticket holders have the extra regular-season game rather than a preseason game, they would pay more because the regular-season game ticket prices are more than preseason tickets.
When the AFC has the extra home game, our ticket pricing for both packages would not be adjusted.
From Patrick
Mark, are the Packers or the league looking into protocols for attendance next season?
There have been reports of a COVID passport that would be portable (in a phone app with bar code) that would show the person's vaccination verification and it may be required at some venues and modes of travel in the near future.
We all missed out on a great season last year.
Most of us would jump thru hoops to attend.
Also, I tried telling Daniel Moss you were my dad when I was applying for club box season tickets several years ago.
I am 73 and he didn't buy it.
We have been season ticket holders for a few years now and absolutely can't say enough about the wonderful way we are treated.
Molly is an outstanding member of your premium seating team and has been a treat to have as our contact.
Murph
Good question, Murph.
(I hope you don't mind me calling you Murph.)
We are looking into what we can do this season to maximize our attendance safely.
I anticipate that, like last year, we will rely heavily on our local health officials.
Obviously, the status of the vaccine rollout will be crucial in this regard.
The new Johnson & Johnson vaccine will be very helpful.
I was encouraged to hear President Joe Biden say that by the end of May, everyone in the country who wants to be vaccinated will be able to get the shot.
A key will be encouraging people to get the vaccine.
Lastly, thanks for your comments about your treatment from our premium seating team, and, in the future, I suggest you say you are my older brother.
Adilson from Rotterdam, The Netherlands
On Nov. 19 last year, Cliff wrote a great in-depth piece about the inaccurate assumption that Vince Lombardi called Forrest Gregg the greatest player he ever coached, even though he actually said that about Paul Hornung, a misconception that has unfortunately been repeated by the Pro Football Hall of Fame, even in the respective obituaries.
I was wondering if it was possible for the Green Bay Packers to inform Canton of this unintentional error so that it can be corrected.
Cliff's outstanding work, track record and reputation are unquestionable, and considering your own motivation to get the history of the team right, something I've respected greatly about your stewardship of the Packers, I hope it can be rectified in the near future.
All the best to you and your loved ones during these trying times.
Go Pack go!
I'm glad you brought this up, Adilson, and I appreciate your praise of Cliff Christl.
I couldn't agree more regarding Cliff – he is a tremendous asset.
He is a perfectionist and is so respected, I think he is the right person to contact the Pro Football Hall of Fame regarding the error.
I realize it is not easy to make some of these changes, but the Hall should have accurate information.
Cliff has been in contact with the Hall on these matters and has been encouraged with the initial conversations.
Scott from Ramsey, MN
Hi Mark, for some time, the ability of someone with a 16-game schedule to break a record from someone who played a 12-game schedule has bothered me, and will even more with the anticipated transition to the 17-game schedule.
Has the league ever considered listing records on a games-per-season basis?
Not thinking about actual games played, but games that would have been played that year: 12, 14, 16, 17, depending on the year.
That keeps some consistency and doesn't allow someone with a great half-season to sneak in if injured the other half of the year.
Thanks for all you do for the Packers and the Green Bay area, especially this past 12 months.
Very interesting suggestion, Scott.
I am not aware that there has ever been any consideration given to the idea.
As you note, with the expected move to 17 games, now would be a good time to consider this change.
It is always hard to compare players from different eras, and putting statistics on a per-game basis would help in this regard.
If you based statistical honors on a per-game basis (e.g.
rushing champion), though, you would have to require that a player play in a minimum number of games.
It is often said in the NFL that the most important ability is availability, and being able to play in most or all of the games is not easy in the NFL.
While I'm intrigued by your suggestion, I do not anticipate the league making this change.
Bob from Cortez, CO
Friends of mine with children have commented on the lack of endless rounds of colds and flu children bring home from school that infect the rest of the family members.
We assume the preventive measures taken because of Covid-19 have limited the spread of other diseases too.
In the past, the flu and various colds have caused players to miss games.
Going forward, do you see the Packers organization continuing many of these Covid-related protocols to protect the team's health?
Excellent question, Bob.
As I mentioned above, while we are optimistic that things will be better this year with regard to the virus, I think most of the protocols will remain in place for this year.
Long term, I think some of the protocols (e.g.
washing hands, temperature checks) will make sense to remain in place to help keep our players healthy.
Lastly, I know I may be old-school, but I could never imagine missing a game because I had a cold or the flu.
Actually, though, the most serious injury I suffered during my career occurred when I played a game with the stomach flu.
Maybe it wasn't so smart to play with the flu.

GREEN BAY – Aaron Rodgers was waiting in the green room prior to his "Celebrity Jeopardy!"
appearance in 2015 when the door swung open and legendary host Alex Trebek entered.
Instantly, the Packers' MVP quarterback and Super Bowl champion was teleported back in time to when he was just a kid sitting on the floor of his grandparents' house watching the iconic game show.
"When he walked into the room that first time … he has such a presence and such a charisma," said Rodgers in an interview with "Jeopardy!"
prior to his 10-episode residency as guest host beginning Monday.
"Everything kind of got quiet.
It's like, 'Oh my God, there's Alex Trebek.'
That was a really special moment."
A devout fan of the show, Rodgers has watched virtually every episode during his 16 seasons in Green Bay, estimating "probably 90% of my TiVo is wrapped up in 'Jeopardy!'
episodes."
Having previously won during his 2015 appearance, Rodgers was approached earlier this year about serving as one of the show's interim hosts, a rotation "Jeopardy!"
began after Trebek passed away last November following a two-year battle with pancreatic cancer.
Rodgers jumped at the opportunity, investing the same level of detail into his preparation as he does for an NFL game.
"Just respect, respect for the position," Rodgers said.
"Alex did it with such grace and humility.
I just wanted to bring the same type of approach to let you people know that I was focused, I cared about it, that I loved the game and that I wanted to do him justice."
Rodgers said he used some of his same in-game tactics and "box-breathing" techniques to manage the nerves involved with hosting the show, currently in its 37th season.
He also jotted down tidbits of advice on the podium such as "Slow down," "Speak clearly," and his patented "Relax" catchphrase.
"The key to being football-smart is the focus and the key to really being good at this game or good at hosting is that same focus where you have to have an incredible understanding of the intricacies of the game, and when to insert yourself and when to remove yourself," Rodgers said.
"As a ('Jeopardy!'
) player, you have to be good on that buzzer.
You have to have such focus on the host reading that you understand when he's done and that board lights up, that's when I can get in.
Because a lot of times it comes down to that ability to get in at the right time, especially when you're playing with some really amazing players."
A native of Chico, Calif., Rodgers is using his guest spot to raise money for the North Valley Community Foundation, a non-profit organization in Butte County raising money for individuals and small businesses affected by the California wildfires and ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Rodgers and NVCF announced on Saturday that "Jeopardy!"
is matching winnings of all contestants and donating it to Rodgers' small-business COVID-19 fund.
"Thanks to 'Jeopardy!'
(That donation) is an incredible amount of money that's going to go so far and change so many people's lives," Rodgers said.
"People who have lost hope.
Businesses that are on the brink of bankruptcy.
This cause means a lot to me and I'm very, very thankful for the money that we raised."
As a former "Jeopardy!"
champion, Rodgers listed former Packers center and current NFLPA President JC Tretter, and Washington quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick as NFL players he'd like to see pick up a "Jeopardy!"
buzzer at some point, while also issuing a challenge to his own teammates in Green Bay.
"Being the self-proclaimed smartest guy on the team, I encounter some of my teammates who try to test me from time-to-time, whether it's trivia or some other sort of game," said Rodgers with a smile.
"I'd love to see my linemen, who I love so much but are also very opinionated guys who think they're absolutely brilliant humans.
I'm talking about David Bakhtiari﻿, I'm talking about Corey Linsley and Lucas Patrick﻿."
"I'd like to see those three guys right up here on this stage in a normal 'Jeopardy!'
game or even a 'Celebrity Jeopardy!'
game, which might be a little easier, and just see how well they do."

packers.com senior writer
Packers.com consulted more than a dozen mock drafts from reputable national outlets and compiled a list of players most frequently mocked as draft selections in the bottom third of the first round (picks 20-32).
Between now and draft day, when the Packers are slated to select at No.
29 overall, those players will be profiled with thumbnail sketches in a new series entitled "Draft Digest."
Today's player is …
Jaelan Phillips, Edge, Miami
Height/Weight: 6-5, 266
Key stats: Posted eight sacks, including five over a span of two weeks, among 15½ tackles for loss in 2020, his lone season at Miami.
College honors: Chosen second-team All-America by The Associated Press last season, as well as second-team All-Atlantic Coast Conference.
Background: Phillips began his college career at UCLA and saw his playing time limited due to several injuries (ankle, wrist, concussions; some caused by an off-field moped accident).
He recorded 4½ sacks over two years and 11 games (six starts) for the Bruins before multiple concussions forced him to step away from the game.
Upon deciding to continue playing, he transferred to Miami, sat out 2019 due to transfer rules, and had a dynamite 2020.
Taking advantage of additional playing time due to first-round prospect Gregory Rousseau opting out of Miami's season, Phillips posted eight sacks in 10 starts before sitting out the Hurricanes' bowl game to prepare for the draft.
At Miami's pro day, he clocked a 4.56-second time in the 40, blazing fast for a player his size, and he told reporters he's run in the 4.4s before.
He also bench-pressed 21 reps at 225 pounds.
Potential fit with Packers: It's clear who Green Bay's top three edge defenders will be for 2021 – ﻿Za'Darius Smith﻿ and ﻿Preston Smith﻿, plus ﻿Rashan Gary﻿ – but after that it's wide open, and defensive coaches would never complain about having too many pass rushers.
It's a premier position and the Packers often have more than two edge rushers on the field in passing situations, something new defensive coordinator Joe Barry is likely to continue following the restructured contract that kept Preston Smith around.
In Green Bay, Phillips would have an opportunity to learn from established veteran stars while acclimating to the pro game after essentially one full college season.
How much NFL teams will hold his medical history against him on their draft boards is a valid question.
An impressive pro day certainly helped his cause.

Daniel Jeremiah’s latest mock draft for NFL.com has the Green Bay Packers getting help for the interior of the offensive line in the first round.
Jeremiah sent Alabama offensive lineman Landon Dickerson to the Packers at No.
29 overall.
From Jeremiah: “Dickerson is the best pure interior offensive linemen available.
I thought he might fall out of the first round after his ACL injury, but it appears his recovery is going smoothly.
He can step in following the departure of Corey Linsley.”
Dickerson is Jeremiah’s No.
40 overall prospect in the draft class, mostly due to injuries.
He suffered a torn ACL in the SEC Championship Game last December and could be a question mark for the start of his rookie season.
The Packers would have to feel good about his recovery to make the pick in the first round, but Dickerson’s versatility and playstyle could be highly attractive for a team that needs to keep Aaron Rodgers protected and builds the offensive scheme around the run game.
Over the last two seasons, Dickerson has played over 1,000 snaps at center but also snaps at left and right guard.
The Packers lost All-Pro center Corey Linsley in free agency, opening up possibilities for restructuring the offensive line and giving Dickerson a chance to play immediately once he’s healthy.
According to Pro Football Focus, Dickerson was the second-highest graded center in college football last season.
He allowed only five total pressures and earned an elite run-blocking grade, especially in zone blocking.
With everyone healthy, Dickerson, David Bakhtiari, Elgton Jenkins, Billy Turner and Lucas Patrick could create one of the best offensive lines in football.
The issue here would be the positional value and Dickerson’s injury history.
Is a center or guard coming off a major injury worth the 29th overall pick?
The Packers may have to make that decision later this month.

Free agent offensive lineman Lane Taylor visited his second team since the start of the new league year.
According to the league's transaction wire, Taylor – a starter for the Green Bay Packers to open the 2020 season – visited the Houston Texans on Monday.
Taylor visited the San Francisco 49ers last month.
Both teams likely want to check in on his recovery from the ACL injury he suffered in Week 1 of last year.
Taylor took a pay cut and returned to the Packers in 2020, and a strong summer earned him the starting job at right guard.
He was lost...
The first episode of Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers hosting "Jeopardy!"
aired Monday.
The three-time MVP has nine more episodes airing over the next two weeks.
How did Rodgers do during his opening appearance?
It's time to go to the tape to evaluate the performance.
Here's a light-hearted breakdown of Rodgers' first episode as guest host (note: spoilers ahead):
– Solid intro.
Looks confident, ready for the moment.
Possibly too much swaying back and forth.
He might be fighting some nerves, and that's just fine.
– Terrific job reading the opening categories.
Noted the quotations, emphasized key or interesting words.
Sounds like...
Aaron Rodgers' first episode as the guest host of "Jeopardy!"
included a playful jab at the Green Bay Packers by a contestant during the Final Jeopardy round.
Scott, the two-day champion, didn't have an answer for the final clue, so he wrote down something he knew would get a reaction from Rodgers, the MVP quarterback who is hosting 10 episodes over the next two weeks.
"Who wanted to kick that field goal?"
The answer is, of course, in reference to Matt LaFleur's decision to kick a field goal down eight points late in the fourth quarter against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in...

On the first Saturday of every month, Mark will write about a topic of interest to Packers fans and the organization, and then answer five fan questions.
Fans are encouraged to email Mark with their name and hometown at: MurphyTakes5@packers.com.
When the NFL decided to expand the playoffs this season from six teams qualifying in each conference to seven (four division winners and three wild-card teams), many people were critical of the change.
They felt that it would water down the playoffs, and that more teams with losing records would qualify.
The NFL decided to expand the playoffs for several reasons.
First, playoff games are one of the best aspects of the league and having more of them is a positive (they are certainly a better product than, say, preseason games).
Also, having more teams qualify will keep more teams in contention and there will be fewer meaningless games at the end of the season.
With only the No.
1 seed getting the bye in the first round, there will be more interest in games at the end of the season as teams compete for the top seed, as well as other spots in the playoffs.
In addition, even with the expanded playoffs, still less than half of the teams qualify for the playoffs, a smaller percentage than most of the other professional sports leagues.
Finally, but importantly, playoff games are very attractive to the networks and two additional playoff games will produce additional revenue for the league.
As we enter the last week of the season, the expanded playoffs are certainly having the effect the league had hoped.
In the AFC, three teams have clinched playoff spots and five teams are in contention for the four remaining spots.
Significantly, a team with 10 (or possibly 11) wins will not make the playoffs.
In the NFC, four teams have clinched playoff spots and six teams are still in contention for the last three spots.
Three of the teams still in contention are in the NFC East and they all have losing records.
This would have been the case even if the league had not expanded the playoffs, as division winners have always automatically qualified (and hosted a home playoff game) regardless of their record.
Now, this is the first year of the expanded playoffs, and it may not always have such a positive impact, but it's certainly encouraging.
The last weekend of games should be exciting, and the Packers will be right in the middle of it.
We will secure the top seed and a bye with a win, while the Bears will secure a wild-card spot with a win.
I think the bye is especially important this year due to the pandemic.
The league office has juggled the start times for all of the games this weekend to maximize the excitement and intrigue (and boost the ratings).
The 256th game (the last game of the regular season, on Sunday Night Football) will be the Washington Football Team at Philadelphia, with Washington clinching the NFC East with a victory.
Now, on to your questions…
Mike from MN
Mark, there have been reported discussions of reducing the number of preseason games and adding a 17th regular-season game – possibly even as soon as next year.
Have there been any discussions on how that would affect the distribution of Packers tickets between the Green and Gold season ticket packages?
Thanks, Mike.
This is something that we've addressed here in the past – we will alternate the extra regular-season game so that the Gold season ticket holders have two regular-season games one year and three the next.
This topic has been discussed at recent league meetings, and it's likely that we will move to 17 regular-season and three preseason games next year.
Also, the league determined that the 17th game will be an interconference game and will be based on your place in the standings the previous year.
Next year, we would play the Kansas City Chiefs because they finished first in the AFC West and we were first in the NFC North.
The NFC and AFC teams will alternate hosting the game, so that all conference teams have the same number of home games each year.
A question from Daniel
Hi Mark, I'm seeing a similar trend with this regime as with McCarthy's.
And that is, far too many drives are being ended because of low-percentage pass plays on second- and/or third-and-3 or less yards for a first.
I get the feeling that instead of concentrating on victories, it's more about appeasing the players and stroking their egos.
You took AJ Dillon rather high in the draft and he has done nothing but produce in his extremely limited opportunities.
If Mr. Dillon and this offensive line cannot get three yards on two attempts, then hats off to the defense.
But throwing low-percentage deep fades or having Aaron Rodgers getting sacked on third-and-1 is brutal.
This defense has cost us Super Bowls over the last decade and will continue to hurt us so it is vital to keep them off the field as much as possible.
Rodgers also doesn't run enough to pick up first downs that are within reach.
Certainly, he had some drops but a guaranteed first down by running 12 feet or throwing a bullet to the sidelines to an undrafted receiver on a cold day?
It was not wise to not completely remove the former regime.
Dom Capers and Mike McCarthy should have been removed several years sooner, especially Mr. Capers.
Retaining Pettine was and continues to be a wrong move.
Inability to make in-game adjustments and it's never easy with this Packer team closing out games.
It should not be that way.
You need to be playing AJ Dillon quite a bit more.
Jones and Williams need to accept that and keep the eye on the prize.
They will have far more opportunities once Dillon picks up the first down.
And finally, do not even consider re-signing Kevin King﻿.
A skinny cornerback from the Pac-12 with previous shoulder problems over TJ Watt.
And I'm sure you're aware of the success of all those receivers drafted this year.
I think you'll agree being a former player and personnel man, this franchise has gone for the Kmart Blue Light Special far too often and their lack of championships reflect that.
It would be wise to forget about draft picks that may never materialize and send them off to Pittsburgh for Juju.
Since 2005, I have my draft picks compared to what the Packers did which can be verified by many and it's not even close.
Last year and this team the talent and the football level does not reflect their record and again I do not foresee it going very far in the playoffs.
I'm old enough to remember your playing days and to see the game become nothing but commercials and penalties is really sad.
They stand around on the football field not playing football because they have to sell commercials to pay for their salaries, not to play football.
And the penalties, please, you need to be aware that these are not helmet-to-helmet hits but just the energy of the hit will cause their heads to make contact and nobody will be getting injured anytime soon when their helmets touch in that regard.
Thank God for college football.
Have a safe and exciting holiday.
Remember without the cross there would be no need for the crib.
I do share Mr. Thompson and I believe your faith that Jesus is Lord and look forward to 1st Thessalonians 4:15-20.
Thanks for your thoughts on our team, Daniel.
Not sure there is a question here, but I appreciate the input.
I shudder to think what you would say about our team if we were 3-12 rather than 12-3 now.
Kent from FL
Mark, with the Packers in contention for the top seed and the Super Bowl just an hour down the road, could you please educate regarding how Super Bowl tickets will be allocated to the fan base?
As a 59-year ticket holder, I have always indicated that I want to be in the drawing.
Thank you for your consideration.
Go Pack!
Great question, Kent.
Needless to say, this Super Bowl will be unlike any previous one, especially as it relates to fans.
Although it hasn't been finalized, the ticket situation will be extremely tight.
The stadium will likely be at 20% capacity, and the majority of tickets for participating teams will go to family members of players and coaches.
Tickets for non-participating teams will be even more limited.
Drew from NY
Hey Mark, wouldn't it be great to get tickets for a home playoff game to a decent number of front-line healthcare workers (and other essential workers) who can show proof of being vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2?
I would be more than willing to donate the ticket price for a few of them.
It would provide a REAL home-field advantage and also be a great way to show appreciation to the folks on the front line, and maybe even provide some encouragement to vaccine skeptics.
I realize that it could be a huge logistical challenge, but it would be really cool.
Excellent idea, Drew.
This is actually something that we are considering and hopefully will be able to do for home playoff games.
The league is also looking to invite vaccinated health care workers from the NFL cities to the Super Bowl.
I think it will send a strong message and hopefully encourage people across the country to get vaccinated.
Question 5a: Allen from Green Bay
Dear Mr. Murphy, we have about 50 to 90 employees that have been front-line retail during COVID at the Ashwaubenon/Green Bay Best Buy.
Many of us go to work every day with our wives or significant others worrying about if we will bring home the virus.
I applaud you for having front-line health care workers and first responders come to the games.
What about us that are forced to work to provide for our families so everyone could get their essential electronics to work from home and your Packers to get their gifts for their gift exchange?
Would be cool if you invited some of us to the games.
Also, you should include the food workers that have been providing food for everyone.
You know they really don't want to work during this pandemic either.
All of us provide a service to the community.
Many have the choice to work from home, we do not.
Thank you for listening!
Question 5b: Dennis from Green Bay
Mark, since you opened the stadium for caregivers this last game, I thought you may want to give away tickets to the real heroes for this weekend's game.
Who are the real heroes?
How about the business owners who went bankrupt because of the lockdown?
Business owners on the verge of bankruptcy because of the lockdown?
Parents and families whose children are failing and are depressed because of forced online learning?
These are the real heroes.
They have lost or are losing everything, including their self-esteem.
They can't go to work to make a living.
They can't go to school to get a proper education.
These people can't afford the basics of life as their lives are falling apart.
They DESERVE a break.
Free tickets to a game might be a small ray of sunshine in the midst of their despair.
They need to know there are people aware of their suffering.
If you do this, I hope the TV stations would cover it and offer support to these families.
Who knows, this act of kindness could prevent another senseless suicide because of the lockdown.
Thanks for seriously considering my idea.
Thanks for your suggestions, Allen and Dennis.
We've really been pleased to be able to honor our front-line workers (health care, police and fire department employees) by inviting them to attend our last two home games.
We would like to continue to have invited guests for home playoff games (and the groups that you both mention are providing important services), but I worry about where we would draw the line if we go beyond front-line workers.
As a result, we would like to continue to invite front-line workers, and possibly include front-line workers from beyond the Green Bay area.

Col from Ludlow, UK
Mike/Wes, whilst we in the UK have our fingers crossed for a London game, we might be missing the bigger picture.
Who would pass on Germany, Packers Everywhere pep rally, Oktoberfest, Burgermeister Spoff?
It all works if Wes can double his workload on game day, and pass half of it off as Mike's.
Are you both in?
Let's do London first and go from there.
I might have to work my way up to Oktoberfest.
Rodney from Colleyville, TX
What do you think about ﻿Aaron Rodgers﻿ on "Jeopardy!"
this week?
I plan to watch, and I plan to be entertained.
I expect he'll make the gig look as natural as throwing a back-shoulder fade to ﻿Davante Adams﻿.
Daniel from Waukesha, WI
Do you think Aaron Rodgers will ever be a TV commentator?
For football games?
I think he'd be outstanding at it, but he's never indicated that's something he wants to do, so I'll bet against it for now.
Craig from Elkton, MD
I mowed the grass today.
So that happened.
I got my yard all raked up on Saturday.
I feel so ahead of the game.
Joel from Sand Springs, OK
Mike and Wes, I'm starting to get a little uncomfortable with the new wave of Rodgers feeling uncertain regarding his future.
I know the core of his statement is true and just part of the business of being a professional athlete, but given that this has now been reiterated I'm starting to wonder if there is a rift growing between 12 and the higher ups, or if they should make some sort of move now to make it clear in some capacity for him.
After playoffs felt emotional, this feels different.
I don't know.
Nothing I've heard or read has sounded much different to me.
I think there was this desire, at least from the outside, to gain some additional clarity over the last 2½ months, and that hasn't happened.
Why not?
I don't know.
I'm not going to assume that's a problem until I hear from one of the principals it's a problem.
In the meantime, I'll go back to what I said last week – I hope Rodgers continues to play so well the Packers have no interest in moving on for a long time.
That's where my headspace is.
Neal from Fort Worth, TX
I've been waiting two weeks to ask this of you, as Wes was probably stealing lunches in the school cafeteria in 2005.
When Rodgers was drafted as Favre's heir apparent, I don't recall the media pundits speculating on a bunch of crap like they are with Rodgers/﻿Jordan Love﻿.
Frankly, I'm tired of it.
I don't trust my memory so I'd like to hear how you remember 2005 and why are the two very similar situations being viewed differently in the media?
Kudos for the well-crafted dig on Wes's age.
This is the one piece that has a simple answer in my book.
Because Favre had been musing about retirement since 2003, and Rodgers declared publicly long ago he wanted to play into his 40s and spend his entire career with the Packers.
The contexts are completely different, and that's not the media's fault.
Fariborz from Flower Mount, TX
If we now have AFC vs. NFC for the 17th game, why bother with division?
Why not go No.
1 vs No.
1 all the way to No.
16 vs. No.
16?
Thanks for all the extras on the website in addition to the daily mandatory II posts.
There's merit to your suggestion, but I don't know whether the league considered it.
John from Livermore, CA
What positions will Packers target in the draft and do you see any surprises in Day 1 of the draft?
We've mentioned potential position targets a lot already.
The offensive and defensive lines, plus cornerback, are at the top of the list for me, with linebacker and wide receiver next on the list.
I've yet to cover a first round of the draft without surprises.
Teams keep their intentions so close to the vest and send out a lot of phony signals to further disguise them.
No one really knows what's going to happen until it happens.
Don from St. Paul, MN
Will the Packers draft a tight end or wide receiver in the first four rounds of the 2021 draft?
I'm not about to guarantee anything after how badly I misread what the Packers might do in last year's draft, but I'd say the odds are better for a receiver than tight end.
Wags from Marinette, WI
Who was your favorite Packer draft pick before they played a down?
B.J.
Raji.
I remember thinking he was the perfect fit for the new defensive scheme Dom Capers was bringing to Green Bay, and Raji was really engaging on his conference call the day he was drafted.
He lived up to all of it.
Curt from Algonquin, IL
I just saw that PFF ranked ﻿Allen Lazard﻿ as the highest-graded run blocker out of 108 eligible wide receivers over the last two seasons.
That, to me, is a very important stat that doesn't get enough attention and explains part of the success of our offense.
The commitment to blocking from the receivers is a testament to the character of the team.
Am I suffering from homer bias or have the Packers consistently had the best blocking WRs in the league for most of recent history?
I don't have a mechanism at my disposal to compare them across the league over time.
I just know the Packers have had their share of good ones for a while now.
Whether they've been front-line guys like Donald Driver and Jordy Nelson or further down the depth chart like Ruvell Martin and Geronimo Allison, the blocking prowess has been there, and the duty has been demanded to an even greater extent in LaFleur's offense.
Steve from Lake Stevens, WA
Whether referring to players or the front office, how would you define loyalty in the NFL?
Personally, I don't see any or expect it.
This business is as cut-throat as it gets, and if your job is connected to winning games, that's what comes first.
Loyalty can be a byproduct of that, but it's never the other way around.
Daniel from Pueblo, CO
II, do you think the opponent for the London game would think it is a Packers home game given all of the support the Packers have from across the pond?
I think the Packers fans over there are going to do everything in their power to turn Wembley or Tottenham into UK Lambeau.

Carmen from Trimbach, Switzerland
What would it take for the Packers to have "defensive dominance"?
I'm sure Spoff is right in saying that one CB won't get them there, but what will?
Is it a matter of personnel, scheme or something else?
Another Pro Bowl defensive lineman, greater depth at corner, and a presence in the middle that can generate turnover plays.
That's a ton to ask, but that's my wish list.
Nobody has everything, not the way the game is geared toward offense these days.
The Packers have a lot of pieces with regard to pass rush, coverage, and stopping the run.
But they need more.
Everybody needs more.
Richard from Madison, WI
"Another ﻿Kenny Clark﻿ would do just fine."
On behalf of the American Institute for the English Language, I am pleased to award you this honorary doctorate for setting a new world standard in the art of understatement.
So I got that goin' for me, which is nice.
Dan from Toledo, OH
By saying the chances of an O-lineman at the end of Round 1 are better than a D-lineman you've now virtually guaranteed we take a D-lineman.
(Perhaps a reverse jinx executed on purpose?)
I look forward to what "player to be named" can accomplish next to Kenny Clark.
You give me too much credit, but if you're right, I'll take it.
Sam from Greendale, WI
Unlike the MLB and NHL, the NFL has not retired a player number league-wide.
I don't see that ever happening.
Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier and Wayne Gretzky has several untouchable records.
What would an NFL player have to do to get their number retired league-wide?
The only one I can think of even coming close is Brady who has won more Super Bowls than several franchises.
I don't see the league ever retiring a number in that fashion.
If the league were so inclined, it would have done so for one of the game's pioneers by now.
That's not an indictment or accusation of an oversight, but more a reflection that some of the most influential people in shaping the NFL as we know it today never put on a uniform.
Dick from Four Oaks, NC
Following up on Matthew from Teaneck, NJ, re: the bye week.
It's always bothered me that, as an example, the Pack might have their bye in Week 5, the Bears in Week 7, the Lions in Week 9 and the Vikings in Week 10.
Why can't the entire division have the same bye week?
NFC East – Week 6.
AFC South – Week 7.
NFC West – Week 8, etc.
Seems the most fair to me and really doesn't hurt the TV schedule.
Please pass along to Mr. Goodell with our highest recommendation.
Thanks!
The weekend Inbox was chock full of ideas for how to disperse the bye weeks more fairly.
Have a whole conference off one week, the other conference the next.
Cram all the byes into Weeks 8-11.
By division, as outlined above.
The list goes on, and the Inbox had them all and then some.
I think it's time to realize the NFL doesn't care about the bye weeks being fairly distributed or it would have devised a system accordingly by now, don't you?
The league cares about having as few markets as possible without a relevant game to watch on any given Sunday.
It doesn't want a whole conference, or whole division, off in a given week because the fear is it'll take too many eyeballs off the games.
Are there more fair and equitable ways to schedule the bye weeks?
Of course!
But that's never been the question.
Terry from Sun Prairie, WI
What player do you think was the most surprising from last season?
Easy.
﻿Krys Barnes﻿.
For him to do what he did as an undrafted rookie, without any OTAs or preseason games and while battling some injuries too, was remarkable.
I look forward to seeing where his game goes in Year 2.
Packers LB Krys Barnes celebrates his birthday Apr.

Not a good start for the Brewers, Mike Spofford!
They made their former arch-rivals from across the river look good!
No, wait … maybe the Twins are good.
Never mind.
The Twins are a good squad, and the Brewers were lucky to take one from them.
Milwaukee's offense tagged Minnesota's pitching staff with just two earned runs in the entire series – on a bases-loaded walk and a solo homer.
Not a good start for the bats.
Jerry from Erie, PA
Hello Mike, I would like your valued opinion on the baseball extra-innings rule to put a runner on second base.
I follow baseball almost as well as the NFL and I love both sports.
I just want to know from you, please, being a huge fan of baseball yourself.
What is your take on that rule?
I admittedly struggle with it.
I completely understand wanting to do away with the marathon 15-inning regular-season games that deplete pitching staffs and produce roster moves galore for the next week.
But the purist in me doesn't like things that feel gimmicky, and winning (or losing) a game via this extra-inning rule doesn't seem like it should count the same as a more traditional victory (or loss).
I've decided I can live with it, even if I'm not crazy about it, and I suspect I'll get used to it over time.
Jim from McLean, VA
Being a college basketball fan for 45 years and having spent eight years at Carolina, I've witnessed a lot of great games.
The UCLA-Gonzaga game has to be one of the best games I've ever seen.
I concur.
Considering the stakes, the underdog status of the Bruins, and the undefeated record for the Zags, that was one of the greatest games in the history of the tournament for me.
And I felt that way before the last shot went in.
Tonight's game has almost no chance to measure up, but wouldn't it be something if it even comes close?
Happy Monday.
HAVE A QUESTION?
It takes a village of scouts to draft a player
The complexion of an NFL schedule often looks vastly different come December
There's plenty of value in chemistry and continuity
It has to be a first, or very rare
There's no telling how it shakes out
It just means the game is the game
There's no reason to prioritize one position
Explosiveness and vision are what make Aaron Jones special
It's not easy making the cut
The D-Train isn't just a slogan.
The camaraderie is real.
Who are the best defensive players drafted over the last 30 years?

The Green Bay Packers have re-signed TE ﻿Marcedes Lewis﻿ and DL  ﻿Tyler Lancaster﻿.
General Manager Brian Gutekunst announced the transactions Tuesday.
Lewis spent the last three seasons with the Packers, appearing in 47 regular-season games with 30 starts and registering 28 receptions for 302 yards (10.8 avg.)
and four touchdowns.
He also started all four postseason contests for Green Bay over the last two seasons.
Lewis is one of only seven tight ends in NFL history to play in 200-plus regular-season games (217) and post 400-plus receptions (403).
Lewis spent the first 12 seasons of his career with the Jaguars after being selected in the first round (No.
28 overall) by Jacksonville in 2006 out of UCLA.
He played in 170 games with 157 starts in 12 seasons with the Jaguars and joined WRs Jimmy Smith (12,287) and Keenan McCardell (6,393) as the only players in team history to record 4,000-plus career receiving yards (4,502).
Lewis ranks No.
3 in Jaguars history in receptions (375) and No.
2 in receiving TDs (33).
He started all five postseason games he played in for Jacksonville, recording 10 receptions (No.
4 in franchise history) for 111 yards (11.1 avg.)
and a TD.
Lancaster originally signed with the Packers as an undrafted rookie free agent out of Northwestern in 2018.
He has played in 43 regular-season games with 18 starts over the past three seasons, recording 92 tackles (48 solo), six tackles for a loss, 1.5 sacks, three QB hits, a forced fumble, a fumble recovery and a pass defensed.
Lancaster has also seen action in four postseason contests, starting three, and has posted 10 tackles (five solo).

packers.com senior writer
Hi everybody.
Thanks for logging on today.
Hope everyone is off to a Happy New Year.
Let's get started.
Who do you see as the most likely upsets this weekend?
AFC and NFC?
I don't know if any results in the AFC could be considered upsets.
All 3 of those games are toss-ups in my book.
Should be some really entertaining stuff.
As for the NFC, it feels very different.
I think Seattle, Tampa Bay and New Orleans are very clear favorites.
But in the NFL, having all 3 go as expected is never a given.
Which one might not?
I have no idea.
Mike, thanks for the chat.
We missed you being on there and all, but Larry did a great job on Unscripted!
I want to sit and watch a game with him at a bar sometime.
Great knowledge and great way in which he shares it.
Big props to Larry for stepping in when I couldn't be in the office yesterday.
He can make himself at home in any situation, and it looked like Wes had some fun, too.
I've had the opportunity to sit in a bar, usually at the Combine in Indy, with Larry and our digital/video crew and listen to some stories.
He's a treat.
Hey Mike, what happened to ﻿Rashan Gary﻿ during the beta game?
I barely saw him.
Was he used sparingly as part of the scheme against a specific opponent?
He played around half the snaps on defense, I think.
Maybe a little less.
I'm guessing since he's been banged up here and there the coaches were judicious with his snaps to help get him fully healthy for the playoffs.
I thought when he was in there Sunday, he was impactful.
Hey Spoff, who do you think will need to be the biggest playmaker in order for us to win in these playoffs other than ﻿Aaron Rodgers﻿ of course?
It never hurts to have a surprise someone make a big splash play or two, but in the playoffs it most often comes down to your best guys, which for the Packers on offense are ﻿Davante Adams﻿ and ﻿Aaron Jones﻿, along with Rodgers.
They will carry the offense as far as it goes.
Mike, ﻿Elgton Jenkins﻿'s versatility has been discussed in detail as well but I am really impressed that ﻿Billy Turner﻿ has played guard and both tackle positions so well.
That signing looks better all the time.
His versatility was a big reason for the signing in the first place, and it's paid off.
Woodson seems like a lock to get into the HOF this year.
What do you think are Butler's chances, given the quality of the class?
I've said before that while I fully believe Butler is deserving and he will get in at some point, this year might be a tough class to crack.
You've got two sure first-ballot guys in Woodson and Manning, and maybe a third with Megatron.
If they all get in, that leaves only 2 spots for the other 12 modern-era finalists.
Those aren't great odds.
But we'll see.
Will " Snacks" and ﻿AJ Dillon﻿ get more snaps in the playoffs?
﻿Damon Harrison﻿ played a dozen snaps in Chicago and I'm not sure he'll play much more than that.
Maybe if an opponent has a run-heavy plan he will.
Dillon is hard to gauge.
I'm sure the plan was to use him more against the Bears but the Packers only had 44 snaps on offense.
Usually a team is in the mid-40s for snaps by the end of the third quarter.
Is ﻿Tavon Austin﻿ going to be given another chance or did he blow his shot for the post season run?
I don't know.
The three coordinators are speaking with the media shortly after this chat, so we'll see what Mennenga says.
The Packers would love to get more out of their return game, and Austin gives them that chance, but they aren't going to push for it at the expense of ball security.
It's not worth it when you have an offense this good.
On Monday an II question asked what ARs passer rating would have been if ﻿Marquez Valdes-Scantling﻿ had caught the 53 yd.
TD pass?
for what it's worth 122.7.
I don't think it works that way.
The drop by MVS was with 13 minutes left in the third quarter.
There's no way to know how the rest of the game, and therefore Rodgers' overall passer rating, plays out if that play ends in a TD.
As I noted in Monday's Inbox, if MVS catches that TD, in that very moment, Rodgers' season passer rating topped his 122.5, but it would have had to stay there for the last 28 minutes on the clock.
I'm not saying he couldn't or wouldn't have done that, but we'll never know.
Are any of our injured reserve players coming back this season?
I've heard no updates.
The Packers are practicing on Thursday and Friday this week.
We'll be out there to see if anyone is back in the fold.
Mike, who's your pick for X-factor for the Pack in the playoffs?
I know a lot of people are expecting Dillon to be a force, but I think ﻿Dominique Dafney﻿ would be my pick.
He's playing a role LaFleur wants on offense, and we spent a high pick on.
Now that he's shown he (Dafney) can handle it, I expect him to be almost a staple in the offense for the next 2 weeks.
It might be the Big Dog on offense before Dafney, but I could see either making an impact in the passing game.
On defense, if I were to pick an X factor I'd say ﻿Kevin King﻿.
QBs aren't throwing at ﻿Jaire Alexander﻿ much, and King gets INT opportunities here and there.
If he cashes in on one or two, he could change a game.
Are the Packers still allowed to sign someone off a PS from a non playoff team?
Could they target a pure kickoff returner if they wanted to?
Non-playoff teams are usually signing their PS guys to reserve/future contracts right when the season is over so they can't be poached.
Greetings Mike, and Happy New Year to Wes and you!
What will the Packers be doing this week, since they don't yet know who their next opponent will be?
We're putting in a normal work week, for the most part.
As mentioned, the team is practicing on Thursday and Friday.
There's just no game to cover on the weekend, which frees us up to watch the wild-card contests.
I'll be writing a story for the site as soon as GB's opponent is determined Sunday evening.
It is said to beat a team three times in a year is extremely difficult.
Should the football gods deem the Bears to be the team the Packers meet next week, do you see any truth to this saying?
Or does the Packers see this as any other game.
I don't know.
I don't think the Bears are interested in playing the Packers but they'll have no choice if they win.
Both sides would have to make adjustments to their game plans because they just played each other.
So is the HOF game the Raiders/Colts or Packers/Colts...Will that show how Woodson is viewed?
We're a long way from knowing anything like that.
I don't know if the HOF can be sure about having the big ceremony it normally has in August.
Time will tell.
The Green Bay Packers faced the San Francisco 49ers in a 1995 NFC Divisional Playoff game on Jan. 6, 1996.
The Packers won 27-17 and advanced to the NFC Championship.

What game are you most looking forward to this weekend Mike?
I think it's Indy at Buffalo, to be honest.
Indy because the Packers played them in a tight, down-to-the-wire game, and Buffalo because it's fun watching Josh Allen's fearless play at QB.
If you had to pick another WR besides Adams to step up in the playoffs, who would it be?
My sense is that LaFleur and Rodgers will keep giving MVS opportunities.
Even if he only cashes in on half of them, it would still be worth it.
Don't sleep on ﻿Allen Lazard﻿.
He's been a bit quiet since returning from that long layoff due to injury, but he could be due for a big game.
Last Wednesday, I asked "if with so much riding on the Bears game if it might benefit the Packers in the long run?"
In hindsight has it?
Will it?
Rodgers said after the game "it's good to go in playing," meaning go into the playoffs.
I think the Packers played two pretty high-stakes games the last two weeks and that never hurts.
The bad news was losing ﻿David Bakhtiari﻿ in practice in the meantime, but nothing anyone can do about that.
Since they don't play this week, will we still see an official injury report or do we have to wait until next week?
No, there will be no injury report this week.
Next week we'll see the first one on Wednesday if the Packers are playing Sunday, or Tuesday for a Saturday game.
Do you think the progression of our D has leveled the field if we face the Bucs?
For sure.
I think the Packers are a better team now than they were in mid-October.
But the Bucs are playing well, too.
I don't think the first game, which went sideways quickly and got out of hand, would mean much if a rematch develops.
Ingwe....the correct answer is ﻿Rick Wagner﻿'s knee.
If it holds up and we can go 3 games with the line we had against the Bears I like our chances.
Good point.
Hi Mike!
I know it's a big "if" at this point, but if Tampa Bay is the Packers next opponent, what do you think the Packers need to focus on or improve to prevent a similar outcome as the last game?
I don't know if it's about anything specific.
That game just got out of hand.
It happens.
The biggest thing offensively is preparing for that inside LB duo of David and White, coming up with ways to attack them.
For all the talk about beating a team 3 times in one season, teams that beat an opponent twice in the regular season have gone 14-7 against them in the playoffs since the merger.
There you go.
Who do you think the best two tacklers are on our defense?
﻿Kenny Clark﻿ and ﻿Adrian Amos﻿, with ﻿Rashan Gary﻿ and ﻿Krys Barnes﻿ not far behind.
I'm so looking forward to a Bills Chiefs AFC Championship game, how about you Mike?
The AFC could go a lot of different directions, but my gut says the Bills have the best shot at knocking off the Chiefs.
How is the schedule of the postseason created?
As far as I know it is affected by the TV channels, but how does it work?
It's all the league's doing.
The networks that have playoff rights have a certain number of games, but I think the NFL decides on the assignments and time slots, etc.
I don't know if the networks get to put in any preferences, like they can for the regular season schedule.
History doesn't seem to favor the MVP winning the ultimate prize.
If Rodgers were to be robbed of the MVP, it wouldn't bother me as much as losing the SB.
If anything, not getting the MVP might give AR even more motivation...as if he needs it.
What's your take?
He's not going to know if he's won or lost the MVP until the night before the Super Bowl.
His focus is solely on getting there.
Enjoyed seeing Larry on "Unscripted".
What a fun and knowledgeable guy.
But you and Wes make the show.
Was it a challenging transition for you to go from "all print" to multi-media in your career?
In a word, yes.
If you had told me when I got this job back in 2006 that it would evolve into all sorts of on-camera appearances and other avenues, I would have been skeptical how I'd adjust.
I did some TV in my newspaper days, but not a lot.
I still consider myself first and foremost a writer, but I've always tried to be open to new ideas, not resistant, and do my best to make it work.
What's your sense of this team's energy and internal motivation?
Can they stem the tide of a bad quarter in these big games without the fan energy?
I was impressed with how they handled adversity against Chicago in the third quarter.
I wasn't expecting that frankly.
Playoff games are full of momentum swings.
Always are.
I think the last two games -- where Tennessee and Chicago made comebacks and then the Packers had to respond -- were good prep for what playoff games will feel like.
When do we find out if we're playing Sat or Sun?
I'll be late for work if it's the late game Sunday, 1:30 a.m. k/o in the U.K.!
!
The league will be announcing the divisional weekend schedule after the wild-card games are played.
I'm thinking we might find out during the last wild-card game, the Sunday nighter.
Is Barnes the Packer rookie of the year?
It would be hard to pick anyone else.
He's turned into a real find.
As odd as it may seem, the two top seeds do not meet in the SB as often as one may suspect.
Looking into your crystal ball, is this the year we do see such a matchup?
It'll certainly test the value of the bye, because only the top seed in each conference got one.
One of the by-products of the significant TOP advantage the Bears had was the Packers O-line had fewer snaps than one would generally expect.
While the line acquitted itself well, I am a bit concerned about reading too much into such a small sample size.
44 snaps is not a lot, as mentioned, but that Bears' defensive front is as good as they come.
Hicks, Mack, Quinn, with Trevathan at LB.
The Packers got a break when Roquan Smith left the game with an injury.
He's a tough guy to replace and the Packers took advantage.
Hi Mike.
Do you think Bakhtiari will be on the sidelines during the playoff games?
Is he allowed to be?
He's allowed to be, as far as I know, as long as he's continued to get a Covid test daily, but I can't speak to his preference or what his timetable is as far as surgery and the aftermath, etc.
What do you think happens with Cleveland, with Stefanski and multiple players out?
On the other hand Pittsburgh has lost 4/5, and had to have a massive comeback to beat the Colts.
The Steelers rested some guys last week.
Big Ben, T.J. Watt and some other sat out I believe.
That team needed a break, and I think Tomlin will feel better about the rest some players got, with the way their last month was going.
The situation with the Browns is really something.
Those coaches who can't be there, including Stefanski, can't communicate with anyone either.
There's no outside communication with anyone on the sideline.
Regardless of how the post season ends up for the Packers, I truly feel grateful for a special season.
Mostly a rejuvenated and dominant Aaron Rodgers.
It has been a blessing to witness a full regular season across the league.
GO PACK GO!!
!
It's been a fun ride, for sure.
No reason to end for a while yet, though, right?
Enjoyed seeing Larry and Wes on unscripted today, but we missed mike.
Also, noticed they didn't make it to your sponsors without you there.
Larry probably just distracted Wes too much.
Of the NFC games this weekend, who do you feel has the best chance for an upset?
I really don't know.
All three underdogs (Rams, Washington, Bears) have solid defenses, so that gives each a chance.
But they all have such offensive limitations (if Goff doesn't play for LA).
You'd normally say the home team, Washington, except home field this year isn't the same.
If Goff plays, I'll give the Rams the best chance to pull the upset.
How do you feel about some of these defenses in the playoffs?
I mean, Bills are looking scary.
But I have a healthy fear of Tampa.
Not just because its Tom Brady.
I don't expect that to be an easy game.
I mean, they are not going to be run against.
And they have what it takes on defense.
I think people are discounting them.
I don't think anyone is discounting the Bucs.
That offense has been lighting things up the last few weeks, putting up big points, and the defense has been solid all year.
Does it surprise you that teams still throw Jaire's way?
If he doesn't get a pick or at least a PBU, he just might force a fumble.
You can't spend a whole game ignoring a top receiver just because of the opponent.
Jaire has had an outstanding year, but top-level QBs like Brady, Wilson, Brees, etc., aren't going to shy away from him as much as some others might.
What head coaching position do you find more favorable, Jacksonville with the draft capital and available cap space or L.A. Chargers with Herbert and the overall talent on the roster?
If you've got a QB of the future in place, which the Chargers clearly do, that's an attractive job.
I'd say the same about Houston with Watson.
He had a great year and that position is a huge starting point for any new coach.
Just ask McCarthy and LaFleur.
What is the biggest difference between last year's team and this team?
Mainly the offense, if I were to pick one thing.
This offense has been one of the best in the league since Week 1.
The offense was nowhere near this level last year, at any point, really.
Did you see the targeting call during the Clemson-Ohio State game?
I can't take NCAA's "player safety" initiatives seriously until they penalize ridge swivel players for lowering their head to initiate contact as readily as they penalize defenders for making form tackles.
That was frustrating, to be sure.
It's a tough deal.
Where I will give the NCAA credit, though, is using replay for the safety rules.
It doesn't guarantee that they get every call right, as last week proved, but it's better than the NFL's way of fining guys later for safety violations that could have been flagged in the game but weren't, and there was no replay recourse.
That's never made sense to me.
A certain cranky South Carolinian seems to want to trade Aaron Rodgers.
I think this is preposterous.
What do you think?
I just talked to him last week, and he made no mention of that to me.
I think the biggest concern for the Packers is players coming down with Covid and not being able to play.
Is the team taking extra precautions to keep players from getting it?
They're sticking with the same strict protocols they've used for the bulk of the season.
The Packers have been very vigilant and diligent and hopefully (knock on wood) they continue to have success with their approach.
How good is Washington with a healthy Alex Smith in addition to their pass rush?
In other words, how hard would you root for them to beat TB?
Washington's pass rush vs. Brady will be a huge factor in that game.
I'm just not sure Washington can score enough against that Bucs defense.
But that's why they play the games.
I am rooting for Alex Smith and the WFT to knock out Tompa Brady and the Bucs.
Doesn't that feel right to you?
I would have no problem with any of the teams with worse records in the NFC beating the teams with better records, if that's what you're asking.
We never play well after a bye.
What makes you think this time will be different?
Never is a tad strong.
Last year's playoff bye preceded a big home win over Seattle.
What has been the cause of the big improvement at the Safety position?
I think it's a combination of Amos getting more comfortable with the system in his second year, and the natural development of a highly talented young player in Savage.
This is exactly what the Packers envisioned for the position when they revamped it with those two guys in 2019.
What do you think of the Badgers basketball chances this year?
I'm excited.
They have a veteran-laden squad that'll be fun to watch.
The Big Ten is a meat grinder of a league, though.
Mercy.
Is the full playbook opened up for the playoffs…or is there still an Ace up the sleeve in anticipation of a super bowl appearance?
Mostly, you do what you do best.
You do what got you to 13-3.
There's a wrinkle or surprise in almost every game plan, playoff game or not.
It's just whether the opportunity presents itself to make the call.
I think our D is still flying under the radar despite a top 10 finish.
I don't see anyone talking about how the Packers D climbed into the top 10 only in the last few weeks.
The turnaround has been drastic imho and looking at the last four weeks alone might be more accurate of an assessment.
The defense down the stretch turned it up a notch, which is what you want.
The performance against Tennessee was the most impressive.
This is a unit looking a lot different from, say, the Indy game.
LaFleur mentioned he wasn't happy about King playing 10 yards off the LOS on a 3rd and 3.
Was that a message to Pettine/King?
I share his frustration.
It sounded like he was giving a preview of some things he was going to discuss with Pettine, yeah.
Rodgers has stated for years about the opportunity to host a championship game.
Now that the opportunity is here, do you think it puts more pressure on him?
Rodgers seems pretty impervious to pressure.
He's been in plenty of tough situations before.
He embraces the opportunity, however it presents itself.
He's talked all season about mentally being in a good place.
I don't see that changing.
Do you think Brees has lost the snap in his passes?
When I've seen him it looks like everything floats.
I don't think his arm is what it was 15 years ago, but he was never known as having a cannon or anything.
His style has been different most of the way.
His accuracy is still amazing to me, no matter how hard he's throwing the ball.
In net points for the season, we sit between the Saints and Buccaneers for third highest in the league.
Those are the scariest teams and why it is important that any warm weather teams need to come to Lambeau.
Agreed.
That's why the Packers worked for this opportunity.
Now we'll see how it plays out.
With that, I have to go, folks.
Thanks for all the great questions today and we'll talk again next week.
Take care and enjoy wild-card weekend.
Best, Mike

Packers President/CEO
On the first Saturday of every month, Mark will write about a topic of interest to Packers fans and the organization, and then answer five fan questions.
Fans are encouraged to email Mark with their name and hometown at: MurphyTakes5@packers.com.
Last year after eight games, the Packers sat at 7-1.
This year, in spite of numerous injuries, three players missing the 49ers game as a result of COVID-19 and some up-and-down play, we aren't that far off of last year.
We're 6-2 and in a good position to accomplish all of our goals.
The pandemic has made this season challenging for all teams – with a virtual offseason and no preseason games, not to mention all the players who are missing time due to the virus.
The league and the NFL Players Association have agreed on a number of changes (e.g.
more practice squad players, making it easier to bring practice squad players up to the active roster) to the collective bargaining agreement to give teams more flexibility to deal with COVID-related issues.
These changes have proven to be invaluable to teams.
At times on Thursday, the 49ers game felt like a preseason game with so many backups playing for both teams.
In a strange year like this, the best teams will be the ones with depth that are flexible enough to adapt to all the different challenges they will face this year.
With 10 days off (a mini-bye) before we start the second half of the season, we are well-positioned to finish the season strong.
Now, on to your questions…
Roman from IA
Dear Mr. Murphy, my name is Roman and I'm 23 years old.
I am also an owner and my question to you is when you guys did the renovation on the South End Zone, how come you guys never put any ribbon scoreboards on?
Because I think it would be a great idea.
My hope is that some time we can have those put on.
Good question, Roman.
We considered putting in ribbon scoreboards as part of the South End Zone renovation but decided against it.
In my mind, one of the best things about Lambeau Field is that it is not cluttered with multiple scoreboards and videoboards.
Some of the newer stadiums have so many scoreboards that it is very distracting.
Also, a ribbon scoreboard in the South End Zone would only be visible by a percentage of the stadium.
We do want to have enough of the modern amenities that fans expect at stadiums to allow them to follow the game, but we don't want to take away from the charm that makes Lambeau Field special.
We plan to replace the videoboards within the next few years.
A question from Jon
Hey Mark, I keep hearing rumors about trying to pick up a WR before the trade deadline.
Thoughts?
I'm not sure if it's needed.
If we get healthy, EQ starts catching better, and others get healthy on O we might be OK. What about our D?
Can't stop anyone running.
Is Z OK?
Haven't seen him do anything lately.
I hear crap about Pettine, but the guys on the field are too complacent.
Hope we can fix things quickly, so we are legit in playoffs.
Thanks for raising this issue, Jon.
There was a lot of media speculation about potential trades over the last week, and I've heard from many fans.
We had discussions with a number of teams over the last couple of weeks, but internally we all agreed that there were not any trades that made sense for us.
This is obviously a unique year with the pandemic (and the impact it will have on next year's salary cap) and it was uncertain how it would affect the trade market.
Ultimately, I think many teams were reluctant to trade for high-salary players knowing that the salary cap will go down almost $25 million next year.
For us, a key factor was that we wanted to be able to enter into contract extensions with some of our core veteran players.
A question from Tom
Mr. Murphy, you made the comment that, "We respect that process, but we also are concerned with a person being shot seven times in the back.
That is an outcome we do not accept.
We feel it is an example of excessive force of which we've seen way too much recently.
Black people face this at disproportionate levels when it comes to interactions with law enforcement."
Do you think for a moment that Jacob would have been shot if he simply listened to the officer's commands?
I doubt it!
Jacob resisted arrest and did not comply with officers' commands.
He went for something in his truck.
The officers have a split second to make a decision that could affect whether they come home or not.
Jacob had a knife.
"He's got my kid.
He's got my keys," Sheskey heard a woman say, according to attorney Brendan Matthews, who is representing the officer.
If Sheskey had allowed Blake to drive away and something happened to the child, "the question would have been 'why didn't you do something?'"
Matthews said.
Your column makes it sound like he was shot in the back seven times for nothing.
WHEN DOES THE IGNORANCE AND DISOBEDIENCE OF JACOB BLAKE MATTER?
You disobey police who already have a gun on you, you deserve what happened.
Your column is disingenuous and like most entirely takes the blame off the perpetrator.
Most of the incidents I have seen are from people disobeying the police.
I mean how hard is it really to 1) NOT BE A CRIMINAL and 2) OBEY THE POLICE?
Or is that a bar too high for them to attain?
You should be talking about personal responsibility instead of blaming the police.
Oh, and those organizations that the Packers just donated to like LIT are Marxist socialist democratic organizations (and they want to defund the police).
The NFL is losing many fans.
Mr. Murphy, I am disgusted by you.
Thanks for sharing your opinion on this important issue, Tom.
At the time, we said that we didn't know all the facts, but that we believed that seven shots in the back was excessive.
We realize that police officers have a very difficult job and have tremendous respect for them.
We also know that police officers are often put in situations that require difficult, split-second decisions.
That said, though, we still believe seven shots represent excessive force.
We have provided significant support to police departments across the state over the years.
In fact, we are currently working with our local police departments to purchase body cams to help eliminate some of the situations like the Jacob Blake shooting that we've seen in recent months.
A question from Tony
Mark, it's a question of training for a hot humid environment.
You don't turn the heat up; you turn it down to build your body strength up.
I live in Phoenix, the Cardinals used to practice in Flagstaff when they played outdoors in Phoenix.
The Packers went from lethargic to burned out between the first and second quarter.
They were lethargic coming in.
How hot did you make it in the Hutson Center?
Build your strength up, don't tear it down to play in a hot humid environment.
The loss to the Bucs was very disappointing, Tony.
The heat and humidity are always factors for early-season games in Florida, and it is certainly very different weather than what we are used to in Wisconsin.
I believe we practiced outside most of the week leading up to the game.
A key priority for the team was to make sure that we stayed hydrated throughout the week to avoid heat-related issues in the game.
You're right, the game turned quickly in the second quarter, but I think it was due more to the two interceptions than the heat and humidity.
A question from John
Do you get informed about how the GM and head coach will deal with team issues in the offseason?
Examples: run defense, roster, team future?
Yes, John, I stay in consistent contact with both General Manager Brian Gutekunst and Head Coach Matt LaFleur.
Brian, Matt, Russ Ball (executive vice president and director of football operations) and I also meet on a regular basis, typically every other week, to make sure that we are all up to speed on what's happening within the organization.
Over the years, my management philosophy has always been to hire good people and let them do their jobs.
It's important to provide them with the resources and support they need to be successful, but they need to have the freedom to make the decisions that they think are needed.

Packers team historian
I've been waiting for just the right day to post the following questions.
Phil from Mesa, AZ
I've been a Packers fan for the last 10 years and I hope you can help me with a man who was good to me in my teen years.
Billy Joe Winchester, when I met him, I think he told me that he played for the Packers and Raiders.
I thought it was cool that he didn't act like a superstar, though I figured he must have been just a decent player.
He and his wife fostered a few kids and had one biological daughter.
I went to school with all of them.
He helped me complete my community service when I got into a little trouble.
I admired the work he did in his community.
I found out that he passed away in 2011.
This is where I am stuck.
People are telling me that he never played NFL football.
Can you tell me anything about Billy Joe Winchester and his time with the team?
I have been told he played in the World Football League.
Sorry, but no Billy Joe Winchester ever played for the Packers or the Raiders.
I've told people in the seven-plus years I've been Packers historian that nothing has surprised me more than learning how many people over the years claimed to have played for the Packers, but didn't.
Or at least their descendants have made the claim on their behalf based on stories passed down and obviously exaggerated over generations.
I don't know if imaginations ran wild, people were better story tellers back when or what.
But I've heard many a tale.
Anyway, Winchester played in six games for the WFL Portland Thunder in 1975.
He was an all-heart, 5-11, 260-pound defensive tackle.
He also played two years at Oregon State and then transferred to Arizona State, where he played as a senior in 1974.
At both schools, he was an outstanding weight man in track, as well.
But, maybe more than anything, it sounds like Billy Joe was a character.
He didn't make it when he tried out for the British Columbia Lions in the Canadian Football League in 1978, but he left a lasting impression.
Eight years later, one of the Vancouver columnists wrote: "Nobody ever wanted it more than or trained with more enthusiasm than Billy Joe, the nicest man who never made the team.
But he was at his best in the dressing room and in the rookie show, where he performed his never-to-be-forgotten impersonation of a starfish, in which he would run full-tilt at a wall or locker, leap into it with arms and legs outspread, and slide slowly down until he hit the floor.
Sometimes it was an hour before he could do an encore."
Glad to hear he helped you out when you needed it.
Jennifer from Cave Creek, AZ
My father-in-law, William Posorske, has told all of us in his family that his father played on the first Green Bay Packers team.
His father's name was William Kenneth Posorske from Berlin, Wis.
He tells us his dad made $5 a game if he didn't play and $10 if he did.
He talks in great detail about how his father contracted Lou Gehrig's disease and how Curly Lambeau had his father sit on the sidelines later in his dad's life when he was ill and allowed my father-in-law, who was a young boy also to sit there.
My father-in-law is a very successful businessman, a veteran and sharp as a tack.
I know because he has lived with my husband and I for more than 20 years.
He has never made stories up ever, but when I research the 1919 team, I don't see his dad's name.
I just wonder if there is any way to explain this story such as possibly his father played in 1918 before the team became official?
I hope you might be able to clear up this mystery for our family.
Thank you so much!
No Posorske was listed as playing for the Packers in 1919 or 1920, when they were comprised of mostly local players and played an independent schedule.
I couldn't find anything close to that name on the 1918 city team or teams, either.
Nor did he appear in any team pictures.
In 1919, 25 players participated in the Packers' 11 games and 24 of them can be identified.
In the fifth game against Racine, a player listed as Bradlee in the game summary substituted at right tackle for Sam Powers.
As far back as 1959, when many of the original Packers were still living, Green Bay historian Jack Rudolph attempted to identify Bradlee and nobody could remember him or his name.
I haven't been able to come up with a name, either.
From what I've been able to determine, your father-in-law's father took a teaching job at West De Pere High School in 1920.
That's not much more than a five-mile drive from Green Bay.
And there were two players who appeared in single games in 1920 who haven't been confirmed, either: a Smith and a Malle or Malls or a spelling close to that.
But I believe the latter might have been a St. Norbert College student.
I thought maybe I'd find a Posorske playing against the Packers for Oshkosh in 1919 or maybe for De Pere in 1920, but there were no names even close to it.
However, keep in mind, the Packers-Oshkosh game was played on Oct. 26, 1919, and only five days earlier, The Daily Northwestern in Oshkosh said the team was just being organized.
Oshkosh lost, 85-0, the Northwestern's story on the game consisted of one paragraph with no names mentioned and I don't believe the team ever played another game.
It would be conceivable back then for a team like that to pull someone out of the stands to play.
I researched your question more than some of the others here because many of the details you provided proved to be true, and also because I was able to determine William Posorske was an athlete at Oshkosh State Normal School in the winter of 1919 and may have coached, as well as taught, at West De Pere in 1920.
I've found nothing to suggest he played for the Packers, but Lambeau and many of the team's local players from those first two years played on amateur baseball teams, amateur basketball teams, etc., in the summer and winter.
Maybe he played with or against Lambeau or some of the other original Packers in another sport.
I know William played basketball – and I think football – at Oshkosh Normal.
In fact, I even checked the lineups for the Green Bay East High School-Oshkosh Normal football game in 1920, but found no Posorske.
Lambeau was the coach at East High that year.
As far as sitting on the sidelines, I believe the Packers for years allowed people in wheelchairs to watch the game from there.
I don't think Lambeau would have had to give permission for that.
Lea from Madison, WI
I have heard a family story all my life.
My grandfather, Norbert Rondou, was said to play for the Packers prior to them getting into the NFL.
The story goes that there was another team in GB, I have forgotten the name.
This team played the Packers for entry into the NFL.
My grandfather played for the Packers but changed teams for more money.
The Packers won and my grandfather never played again.
Any evidence on this story?
No.
No Rondou played for the Packers in 1919 or 1920 unless he did so under an assumed name.
Nor was there ever a game to determine Green Bay's entry into what was the American Professional Football Association in 1921.
In 1922, a Norbert Rondou, who was 20 years old at the time, was struck in the face by a bat during a baseball game in Green Bay and was reported to be unconscious for five hours.
I've also seen the last name Rondou in box scores, but as you may know, that was a common name in Green Bay in athletic circles and otherwise.
Kathy from Mobile, AL
I have always been told my grandfather played for the Packers in the early years.
Can you give me any information?
George Prudhomme lived in Chicago and was from Belgium.
I've found no record of a Prudhomme playing for the Packers or even trying out.
In the late 1890s, a George Prudhomme played on a championship team at the University of Ottawa in Canada, but that was more than 20 years before the Packers were founded.
And I have no clue if that was your grandfather.
Peter from Denver, CO
My grandfather was from Marquette, Mich.
It has been rumored that he played center for the Packers in two different seasons.
I've heard 1929 and '32, but I'm not too sure.
My grandpa played under an alias because he was playing for the University of Michigan.
His real name was John "Jack" Frisk.
By 1929, I find it hard to believe the Packers would have used any player under an alias.
I think that time period of what Lambeau once called "tramp football players" was over, where they'd travel around the Midwest playing for the team that offered the most money on any given Sunday.
The Packers were 12-0-1 in 1929 and won their first NFL title.
I can't imagine that they would have risked all that by using an ineligible player.
Plus, they didn't need ringers.
They outscored their opponents, 198-22.
Now, if you had said he played in 1919 or 1922, I might not have been as dismissive of the possibility.
I believe a Jack Frisk played at Northern Michigan in the late 1930s, maybe 1940.
If you don't know, I'd check your grandfather's birth date.
Tom from Algoma, WI
A number of years ago, I had the pleasure of caring for a nursing home resident named Modest Reince, who told me he played for the Packers.
He was unable to tell me the year or years.
Do you have any record?
He also was a federal agent that was involved in the shootout at Little Bohemia Lodge in Manitowish, Wis., that involved John Dillinger and his gang.
I believe Modest might have been a federal agent.
In 1934, the same year as the Dillinger shootout, he drove from the small town of Maplewood in Door County, Wis., to Shawano, about a 75-mile trip, to attend the funeral of a treasury agent, who had been killed in a liquor raid in Kenosha, Wis.
But Reince never played for the Packers and I can't tell you for sure that he was at Little Bohemia during the Dillinger raid, either.
Jayson from Derby, KS
I'm writing for some information about my grandfather, Robert Hempen.
It has long been part of my family history that he played for Green Bay under Curly Lambeau.
No Hempen ever played in a regular-season game for the Packers and I can't find any record of him being in training camp.
A Bob Hempen played for the Racine (Wis.) Legion semipro team in 1947.
I realize there were stories in a number of newspapers after that where he maybe told people he played two years with the Packers.
But, no, he never did.
Alan from Green Bay
When I was in high school, I had a math teacher that claimed he played center for the Packers and was from Ripon College.
I think he would have played early 1920s.
His name was Dwight Kenyon.
Could he have been one of the college players that got the team in trouble with the league?
Your teacher never played for the Packers in a league game, but I'm all but certain he started at left guard against the Hibbing (Minn.) Miners in the Packers' only exhibition game before the 1923 season.
During Kenyon's stay in Green Bay, the Green Bay Press-Gazette referred to him only as "Crow" Kenyon, a product of Ripon College.
I can't imagine it's not the same guy as your teacher.
The Packers used only 12 players against Hibbing and Kenyon was the only starter who was replaced.
He left the game in the second quarter.
Why and why he never played again, I can't tell you.
If I had three guesses, I'd say he didn't play well and was cut, he was injured and Lambeau got rid of him so he didn't have to pay him, or he simply quit.
Playing pro football at the time wasn't exactly a life of luxury.
Plus, he probably would have made more money as a teacher.
He was a good player at Ripon.
He was team captain as a senior and weighed 235 pounds, which was big for that time.
Bob from Titusville, FL
Longtime fan here and I appreciate your work and the depth you add to the site.
Back in 1956-57 a football coach showed up at our little upstate New York high school named William "Bill" Skye.
He had played four years at Syracuse and apparently one year in the pros, half with the Giants and then traded to the Packers.
That would have put him on the team sometime in the early 1950s.
He may have played under his family name which might have been Skyinskus or Skyinski.
Injury or something else caused him to leave the pro ranks, but his legend to our little school was magnified by his time playing pro ball.
He went on to have a long career as a high school coach and later as an administrator in the NYS school system.
Can you find a record of his time in Green Bay?
Thanks for being a loyal reader.
On Sept. 8, 1953, the Packers acquired rookie guard Bill Skyinskus, a 16th-round draft pick from Syracuse, in a trade with the Giants for an undisclosed draft choice.
That was a little less than three weeks before the season opener.
Thirteen days later, Skyinskus was waived by the Packers.
He played in two exhibition games against Pittsburgh and Cleveland, but not any regular-season games.
I also found a story in a New Jersey newspaper, where your coach admitted he didn't play in any regular-season games.
So he was honest about it.
Paul from LaPorte, IN
Can you find anything about my uncle Joe Varges playing for the Pack in the early 1950s after the Korean War?
He turned me into a Packer fan.
I found nothing under the spelling, Varges.
A Joe Vargas was a 29-year-old kicker for Santa Clara University when it upset Bear Bryant-coached Kentucky in the 1950 Orange Bowl (at the end of the 1949 season).
But I can find no record of him trying out for the Packers, much less playing for them.
Paul, here's my hunch about how some of these stories that are part of family lore get more and more embellished over time.
In that 1950 Orange Bowl, Babe Parilli was Kentucky's starting quarterback and two years later he was the Packers' No.
1 draft pick.
Bear Bryant was Don Hutson's teammate at Alabama.
Upsetting Kentucky had to be one of the most memorable days of your uncle's life.
He kicked the three extra points in a 21-13 victory.
And, as time passed, what names on Kentucky would he most likely have remembered?
My guess is Bryant and Parilli, both of whom had ties to the Packers.
Who wouldn't brag about beating those two famous or well-known foes?
Also, Joe Vargas became the football coach at Richmond High School in Oakland a year later.
I believe Richmond was an athletic power back then.
Perhaps he also coached or coached against someone who later had ties to or played for the Packers.
And maybe that also had something to do with him being a fan or at least talking up Green Bay.
Pete & Margie, Las Vegas, NV
Our family always thought that my uncle, Paul Bergin, played on the Packers' early teams.
Do you have any info on him?
My apologies, but I'm going to break your heart twice here.
First, my favorite Las Vegas is in New Mexico.
The Las Vegas that is home to New Mexico Highlands, Leonard "Graveyard" Garrett's school.
When we drive to Arizona, it's a must stop, if for no other reason than to check out the football field and be reminded of where "Graveyard" – maybe the best nickname in Packers history – played his college ball.
And, no, Paul Bergin never played for the Packers.
If it's the same Paul Bergin, he was in a bad motorcycle accident in 1915, four years before the Packers were founded.
The Press-Gazette referred to him as a "youth" and said he suffered a fractured skull and wasn't expected to live.
But he did and joined the Navy and was stationed in California at about the same time the Packers made their debut in the fall of 1919.
I did find where he played basketball in 1916 for the Hillsides, a club which fielded youth football teams at the time, and again in 1925 for the Sullivan Legion Post, when at least one or two Packers were teammates.
Also, your relative did have at least one run-in with the Lambeaus.
City councilman Marcel Lambeau, Curly's father, pressed to close his Pine Street tavern in 1933 for violating city sanitation regulations.
But no, they didn't win division in 1982
George Calhoun joining the Press-Gazette ushered in an era of unabashed promotions
President Robert Parins and the executive committee didn't stop him from hiring Ron Wolf
Controversy prevails over Hornung's No.
5 and Canadeo's No.

GREEN BAY – ﻿Elgton Jenkins﻿ was caught off-guard when Packers General Manager Brian Gutekunst called him early Monday morning with the news he had been selected to the Pro Bowl.
Yes, that Pro Bowl.
"I was kind of shocked for a minute," said Jenkins when asked about his reaction on Wednesday.
"I asked him what he said.
He was like, 'Yeah, you made the Pro Bowl.
First-ballot starter.'"
It shouldn't come as too big of a surprise.
The second-year guard has been a valuable – and versatile – member of the NFL's third-highest scoring offense and an offensive line that's allowed just 18 sacks of quarterback ﻿Aaron Rodgers﻿ this season.
As injuries flared up, Jenkins has been the adhesive holding everything together.
His three spot starts at center and one at right tackle made Jenkins, just 24, the first Packers player to start games at guard, tackle and center since the NFL-AFL merger in 1970.
So while Jenkins is certainly deserving of the Pro Bowl, it's rare for a young offensive lineman to garner that sort of attention.
In fact, prior to this week, it had been 68 years since the last time a Packers offensive lineman was voted to the Pro Bowl during his first two NFL seasons (Deral Teteak).
"Can't say enough good things about Elgton," said All-Pro left tackle ﻿David Bakhtiari﻿, who was selected as one of the NFC's two starting tackles in the Pro Bowl.
"He's a talent, and I have to give him credit, he is an offensive-lineman athlete.
I know he's probably got an even bigger head than he already does have from me saying that, but he earned it."
Bakhtiari likes to joke about the "big-brother relationship" he's had with Jenkins since the Packers drafted the latter in the second round out of Mississippi State in 2019 – almost to the point of annoyance at times.
It served a purpose, though.
A starting center during his final two seasons in Starkville, Jenkins was asked to fill the vacancy at left guard between two of the best players at their respective positions – Bakhtiari at left tackle and ﻿Corey Linsley﻿ at center – following ﻿Lane Taylor﻿'s season-ending biceps injury in 2019.
Jenkins proved to be a quick study.
He didn't just fuse the gap between the established veterans – he thrived, and was named to the PFWA All-Rookie Team after starting 16 games (including playoffs).
While listed as the team's starting left guard going into the season, Jenkins made a spot start at right tackle during the opener in Minnesota because both ﻿Billy Turner﻿ and ﻿Rick Wagner﻿ were dealing with lingering injuries from training camp.
Jenkins stayed put at left guard for the next eight weeks until sliding to left tackle in the second half of the Packers' Week 9 matchup with San Francisco after Wagner – already playing in place of an injured Bakhtiari (ribs) – exited with a knee injury.
Most recently, after Linsley succumbed to a knee injury against Philadelphia in Week 13, Jenkins has been playing center again.
With Linsley eligible to be activated from injured reserve this week, however, there is a chance Jenkins could go back to his home base as soon as this Sunday against the Tennessee Titans.
"He's a very intelligent player, and it's not too big for him," said offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett of how Jenkins has handled the position switches.
"He's a guy that just steps up to the challenge, loves the game.
He can do so much, and I think that's just allowed him to play at a high level."
Versatility has been Jenkins' calling card going back to his days at Clarksdale (Miss.)
High School.
For a short time, he was even recruited by the University of Alabama-Birmingham as a defensive lineman before it became apparent his future lied on the offensive side of the ball.
When asked about Jenkins' flexibility, Hackett joked, "The way he's been, we could put him out at wide receiver maybe."
If given the opportunity, Jenkins made a playful quip about possibility slotting himself in at the signal-caller spot.
"I'd play quarterback," smiled Jenkins.
"Just knowing defenses and stuff like that, with the arm I've got, I feel like I could sling it around, break a couple records."
Elgton wasn't the only member of the Jenkins family surprised by the Pro Bowl news.
The first person he called after speaking with Gutekunst was his mother, Delandra, who was "hollering on the phone" after Jenkins told her.
While sworn to secrecy, Delandra proceeded to call Elgton "five or six" more times to double-check until was finally announced on NFL Network at 6 p.m. CT.
Although Delandra might have always known what her son can do on a football field, the league's coaches and players also have taken notice during Jenkins' first two NFL seasons.
"I'm just blessed, man," Jenkins said.
"It comes from hard work, just trying to be the best person I can, on the field, off the field and getting the job done.
The league finally taking recognition, hopefully for the next however so many years it'll keep happening."
Seven Packers were named to the Pro Bowl rosters.

Packers.com consulted more than a dozen mock drafts from reputable national outlets and compiled a list of players most frequently mocked as draft selections in the bottom third of the first round (picks 20-32).
Between now and draft day, when the Packers are slated to select at No.
29 overall, those players will be profiled with thumbnail sketches in a new series entitled "Draft Digest."
Today's player is …
Kadarius Toney, WR, Florida
Height/Weight: 5-11, 189
Key stats: Caught 70 passes for 984 yards and 10 TDs in 11 games in 2020, his lone season as a full-time starter.
Added 580 rushing yards and two TDs over his college career.
College honors: Named first-team All-Southeastern Conference as an all-purpose player last season, and second-team All-SEC at wide receiver.
Background: A speedy, impressive athlete who was a dual-threat QB during high school in Alabama, Toney came to Florida as an all-around offensive weapon who broke out as a receiver last season.
An unclogged depth chart combined with the emergence of Florida QB Kyle Trask helped produce the standout year.
After missing six games due to injury in 2019, Toney played every contest in 2020 until sitting out Florida's bowl game to prepare for the draft.
He's an explosive playmaker with yards-after-catch ability who most analysts say needs to become a more refined route-runner, not unusual for a player relatively new to the position.
He reportedly clocked a 4.38-second time in the 40-yard dash at Florida's pro day.
Toney also brings plenty of skill in the return game, having brought back a punt for a TD last season.
Potential fit with Packers: Head Coach Matt LaFleur's offense has a place for a prototypical slot receiver who can run jet sweeps as well as intermediate and deep routes.
But no one currently on the roster is filling the role previously manned by ﻿Tyler Ervin﻿ and ﻿Tavon Austin﻿, who are both unrestricted free agents.
Toney is the type of athlete with whom offensive coaches can get creative, and there's plenty of development in his game that can be refined.
He'd also bring an instant upgrade to the Packers' return game, which has struggled the past two years except for the stretch run in 2019 when Ervin arrived.

Hey everybody, thanks for logging on today.
Go ahead and start sending in your questions and I'll get started.
Thanks and hope all is well.
Any word when ﻿AJ Dillon﻿ can return?
Nothing yet.
Hello Mike, the upcoming game will be the first this season that I can watch live on TV.
What can I hope for?
Hope for?
I don't know how to answer that.
I think you can expect the biggest defensive challenge for this Packers offense thus far in 2020.
Tampa Bay's defense was really good, I think Indy's might be even better.
It should be a great matchup.
If we were to step into the Twilight Zone and you could ask Coach Lombardi one question (either in person or via Zoom), what would you ask him?
If he had another play in mind aside from the QB sneak that Starr suggested at the end of the Ice Bowl.
Mike, this didn't make the II cut so I'll try again here.
I was pulling for the Bears on Monday night because I don't want there to be any possibility Cook has a chance to run through our defense again.
But then I watched Cordarrelle Patterson run by and run over would-be tacklers time and time again.
Pick your poison?
No comparison.
Cook is way more explosive and dangerous, from scrimmage, than Patterson.
That kickoff return was really something, and that's where Patterson can really hurt you, but Cook is a way bigger problem as a running back.
I'm going to the game on Sunday.
Any tips or insights you can offer me about Lucas Oil?
It's a neat stadium and Indy's downtown is great.
I don't know how active it'll be in the current circumstances, but it's a cool venue.
I know that speed is not everything in jet sweeps, but ﻿Malik Taylor﻿ has speed, and he has acquited himself favorably as a WR, and I thought that he did justice whenever the ball came his way.
Is there a possibility that he could be one of the jet-sweepers in the absence of Swerve?
He could be, but I still think the better options are ﻿Aaron Jones﻿ and ﻿Marquez Valdes-Scantling﻿ if ﻿Tyler Ervin﻿ is sidelined again.
Is this game the toughest test the Packers have left on their schedule?
Hard to say.
The Tennessee game will be no picnic.
I know the Colts just beat them.
The Bears have their bye to figure things out and the Packers have two left against them.
This is a tough game, but there are plenty of challenges still ahead, win or lose.
Aaron Jones makes Packer offense look different.
Hope Packers keep him.
Couldn't agree more.
Hi Mike.
It's my birthday today and can you tell me how good is ﻿Rashan Gary﻿ doing this year?
Go Pack Go!
Well, happy birthday.
Gary's finish on the final drive on Sunday was impressive.
He's coming along and earning more playing time I think.
What is the answer for 3 and 1?
Short yardage situations continue to hamper the offense and there is not much consistency to win these battles in the trenches..
They just have to execute the blocks up front.
That third-and-1 with Jones was blocked well except for one guy, and it wrecked it.
That said, they've had more success with ﻿Jamaal Williams﻿ on third and 1 than Jones this season.
What was more alarming in the last game was the number of third-and-3s that failed.
They were in manageable situations much of the game but couldn't convert on several.
Any thoughts on ﻿Aaron Rodgers﻿'s remarks that he would prefer coaching high school football to a TV commentary gig post-retirement?
Didn't surprise me at all.
I've never seen him as someone interested in going to the broadcast booth.
Favre did the same thing, helping a high school program when he first retired, if I recall.
This game will be a great test.
Will make for a very intriguing matchup.
Colts defense is #1 for a reason.
First in total yards allowed, second in passing yards allowed, third in rushing yards allowed, fourth in points allowed.
And they shut out Tennessee in the second half last Thursday for a huge win.
Yes, this is a big test.
Why didn't we draft or trade for a WR?!
Just kidding.
I like our WR room.
Speaking of, with ﻿Allen Lazard﻿ coming off IR, any indication on if he's ready to resume his normal snap count?
Or do you think he will be slowly brought back into the rotation?
We'll have to see if he's listed on the injury report this week, and if he's a limited or full participant in practice.
That'll be the first sign.
But I do think it would be tough after his layoff to suddenly go out and play 60 snaps on Sunday.
Do you see having both ﻿Jaire Alexander﻿ and ﻿Kevin King﻿ back and healthy (sometime hopefully soon) would allow us to drop a safety in the box more to help shore up the run defense?
The backup corners have been impressive but down two starting corners is a tall order to fill.
Yeah, losing your top two corners is tough on any defense.
The Packers held up well against a rookie QB who was missing his No.
2 receiver and playing in bad weather, but Sunday indoors vs. Rivers will be different.
It would be a huge boost to the defense to get Alexander and King back.
We'll just have to see.
Do you think the Packer offense on Sunday will be as healthy as it's likely to be for the rest of the season?
Perhaps, but I'm not sure about Ervin after he left the Jags game.
As much as the offensive line has made all the shuffling work, I'm sure they'd like to get their best 5 playing regularly each week.
And getting back to ﻿Davante Adams﻿, Lazard and MVS as the top 3 WR should help, too.
A friend of mine says barring injury to #12, the Packers will go 6-1 the remainder of the season.
I think that is overly optimistic.
What do you say?
I don't project things that way because so much can change week to week in this league.
Sunday is a big game.
That's enough to think about.
Hi Mike, if King and Alexander are going on Sunday I like our match up against the Colts receivers.
This defense is always better with those two guys on the field together, which unfortunately hasn't been enough.
But it just gives Pettine so many more options.
﻿Adrian Amos﻿'s game has been steady this year, but does it seem like ﻿Darnell Savage﻿ is in a bit of a sophomore slump?
I wouldn't call it a slump.
He's not making the splash plays everyone was hoping for after a solid rookie season.
I still think he's plenty capable.
He dropped the easy one at SF.
Philip Rivers has had some big days against the Packers in the past.
What's the key to stopping him?
You have to stop the run to take away play-action and then make him hurry.
He'll get the ball out quickly, but if he has to take the short stuff, then the defense has to tackle well.
Hi Mike, how crazy is it that the Packers have had to deal with 40+ mph wind gusts in back to back home games?
The offense still has to find their rhythm consistently for sure.. but that's got to be the toughest element to deal with.
More strange occurrences in a strange season.
It probably means one of these December home games is going to be a sunny, balmy, calm day.
Mike, I've seen ﻿JK Scott﻿'s tackle attempt compared to a "Kramer-style pratfall".
Any insight as to the ribbing he's surely taken from his teammates?
No idea.
I'm sure he's not proud of it, and the film session probably wasn't fun.
But we don't have access to the locker room like usual to ask about those things this year.
Fortunately everyone can laugh about it after a win.
Will King's injury history result in this being his last year with the Packers?
I don't know.
The time he's missing this year might be driving down his price as a pending free agent, because he's only had one fully healthy season out of four.
Whether that means he comes back to GB, I have no idea.
Yikes on seeing Philip Rivers so soon after last year and the numbers he put on us back in 2015, how has his Indy season been going?
He's thrown 7 picks but his passer rating is still above 90 on the season.
He's completing almost 70 percent and he's only been sacked 8 times in 9 games (see comment earlier about getting the ball out quickly).
Packers never won a game at Lucas Oil Stadium.
Time to rewrite the history.
Don't you think?
They certainly should have won the game in 2012, which is the only one I've covered there.
That was brutal to watch in the second half.
We're the #1 seed, but it feels weird to root for New Orleans drifting further down given Brees' injury.
Hopefully he's not out too long.
It's terrible what happened to Brees and hopefully he comes out of this OK.
I can't imagine how much pain he was in Sunday.
I thought Gary had a bad game until that last 2 series, primarily because I did not notice him during the game or hear his name called.
But I also read that he had a good game.
Was that recency bias - the last few snaps being monster snaps for him?
Crunch time decides a lot of games in the NFL, and when guys can perform in those moments, it really matters.
If the Packers can rush the passer like that in close fourth quarters, it'll go a long way.
With ﻿David Bakhtiari﻿ now extended, how tough do you think it will be for Gutekunst to get deals done with ﻿Corey Linsley﻿, King, Jones, and Williams?
Especially with a depleted salary cap next season.
Packers need to be ready for most if not all of those players walking away.
It's about setting your priorities and working on them.
I would suspect the next priority is either Jones or Linsley, but Gutekunst isn't going to specify which one.
Clearly Clark and Bakhtiari were the top two priorities and those are done.
Wow, rough special teams outing!
What is going on with Scott and I know the winds were tough but someone make a fair catch.
Probably added up to 40 yards of missed ground!
The Packers lost a ton of yardage in the kicking game on Sunday, even without the long punt return against them.
I'm sure it wasn't easy to catch punts in those conditions, but something has to improve there.
Do you see Gary getting more snaps for ﻿Preston Smith﻿ going forward?
Maybe, or Pettine will try getting both Smiths and Gary on the field together.
We'll see.
Saw a stat that in past 2 years MVS is 4th in league in catches of 40+ yards!
If he can be somewhat consistent with the shorter routes as he was last week, look out!
That's why I commented on Unscripted yesterday about how strong a game that was for MVS -- the variety of plays he made.
Long bomb, shallow cross for an explosive gain, saving a third down on a scramble drill, WR screen against the slot blitz.
He made plays in a lot of different ways and that's what needs to continue for him.
How to beat the Colts defense?
More run, more pass?
Do they have a weakness?
Or must we hope the bad version of Rivers is on the field Sunday?
I'm not sure they really have a weakness, but in general you want to try to stay balanced.
If they get you one-dimensional it makes it that much harder.
Stay balanced to keep them honest and execute.
When's the last time you got to play racquetball?
It's been over seven months for me.
I gotta figure out some way to exercise while reading II and doing mid-week chats...while at work.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure early March was my last game.
Not good.
Lot of fans asking what results in other games would best favor the Packers.
It seems to me that the Packers control their own destiny.
If they win out they own the number one seed in the NFC.
Is that accurate?
Yes.
Any word on Adam's ankle?
Nothing yet.
He's scheduled to speak to the media after practice today so we'll see what he says.
Is it too much to have the Smiths, Kenny Clark and Rashan Gary on the field regularly at the same time?
That's probably the best four-man rush in an obvious passing situation, and Pettine has gone with that a lot.
It's not the best run front, though, so you have to pick your spots.
Does it make it easier to see Rivers two seasons in a row?
Thinking the four year gap ala 2015 to 2019 puts a very different defense on the field.
Interesting thought.
I don't know.
He's with a new team now, new personnel around him, probably not the same system (though some similarities).
Matt LaFleur now 20-5 (.800) without back-to-back losses....not a bad start to a coaching career?
Ya think?
I was really glad to see MVS step up last week (and week before).
I hope that continues.
If he stays confident and we get Lazard back, we have an awesome three receiver set.
It changes the landscape for how teams will defend Adams and Jones, I believe.
There was much criticism about Sunday's game.
But with wind conditions, a rare interception and fumble by guys who normally do not commit such errors and a 90-yard punt return they still got a W. That's coming up BIG in the face of adversary.
They pulled it out at the end, but all those things you mentioned made it a sloppy performance.
The Jags special teams didn't make any huge mistakes, and their only turnover was when the TE fell down.
The Packers made the avoidable mistakes and it almost cost them a game.
Ka'dar Hollman looked great in your WYMM segment.
Did you happen to notice how he looked on some plays not shown?
I thought he was solid.
The Jags only having a couple of 20-yard pass plays is a testament to the work of the whole secondary against the pass.
I'm sure there are plays he wants to improve upon.
What stands out to me is he can run.
He has closing speed.
Check out photos of Lambeau Field as the snow falls on Nov. 16, 2020.
The NFL has said the lost revenue this year will be spread over several years in regards to the cap.
Any reason to think 2022 the cap will be back to "normal"?
Lot of contracts out there that are scheduled to make a huge jump in 2022.
We'll just have to see.
All those calculations will be made after the season is over, assuming we're back to full stadiums in the fall of '21.
But the cap dip isn't going to be just for one season.
The '22 cap and probably '23 will be down considerably, too, but then everything could change if/when new TV contracts are negotiated.
I would have thought going into a game with a broken rib was asking for trouble.
Why would teams do that?
The Saints were not in dire straits, and could very well have rested Brees.
I can understand the player wanting to play...
I am disappointed in the Saints medical staff.
From what I understand, they didn't know he went into the game with a broken rib.
It didn't show up on the scans they did after the previous game.
That's what was reported anyway, if I heard it right.
In your opinion, which Packers are deserving of a Pro Bowl starter vote if any.
My number one who comes to mind is Linsley.
Seems like not many talking about what seems to be a career year.
As far as guys who haven't gotten it before, I really hope Linsley and Mason Crosby make it this year, even though the game isn't being played.
I also think Alexander is deserving.
The Browns haven't been in the playoffs since 2002.
Wouldn't it be interesting if they finally get in this year, but only because they squeak into the new 7th seed?
I'm sure they won't complain.
I don't recall which of the Smith's it was, but after a sack, he was down on his knees, looking to celebrate, motioning to his teammates, but they just all walked away and he appeared to shake his head/roll his eyes.
A reflection of lack of energy or cohesiveness?
That was Za'Darius Smith﻿, and maybe they figured he was just going to do his own thing.
I don't know.
Knowing the Packers can't sign everyone they would want, do they make someone on the bubble a low-ball offer in the hope that just maybe they accept it?
Or would the player see that as an insult?
The latter is always a risk.
If you want to keep a guy, be fair to him.
You can always tell him to check back depending on what other offers he gets on the market and make the decision that way.
If you have good relationships with agents, they'll work with you like that.
Roster depth so important with decisions on potential FA's.
Linsley is so solid, but moving Lucas Patrick or Elgton Jenkins to center and sliding a youngster like Jon Runyan in at guard potential saves enough to sign Jones.
Tremendously difficult decisions for the GM....
Yeah, it's not going to be easy.
They won't be able to bring everybody back, but like I said before, I'm not sure who the next priority is.
Does it seem to you that the Packers run game has regressed?
Are defenses playing us differently than the first few weeks?
It just seems like we have not been able to consistently move the ball & get first downs (and points!)
like we were able to in the beginning of the year.
It hasn't been as steady and consistent as it was earlier, and I'm sure LaFleur is working to figure it out.
This offense is at its best when the run game is respected and Rodgers can run play-action.
That's how they were lighting things up earlier.
They'd love to get back to that, but it's easier said than done.
The season is long and defenses adjust.
Been a big fan of JT since he was a Badger (how could you not be) but I know he has struggled with fumbles.
Do you think the D-train is practicing popping the ball out more so than usual?
They've made a habit of going for the ball much of the season.
I'm sure they're aware of Taylor's reputation.
Feel bad for McCarthy in Dallas.
Lost his star QB and many others in a year of transition and pandemic.
Yet through it all they are still alive because of the NFC East.
Go figure.
2020...
Yeah, that division is crazy.
Who knows?
What positions on offense has a Packer not made the NFL Hall of Fame?
I can't think of any on defense where no Packer is in Canton.
The Packers don't have a tight end in Canton, I don't believe.
In your opinion, what has been the Packers' most consistent game, defensively?
I thought the performance against Atlanta was a solid, all-around defensive game.
Interesting that Gary is only 22.
Kenny Clark was only 20-21 when drafted, and I believe Jonathan Garvin is also very young.
Obviously it may take a little while longer for these players to develop, but it seems like TT and BG may factor that into their draft and develop process.
Absolutely.
Big difference between taking a guy in the first round as opposed to the seventh like Garvin, but it's all about the crystal ball and what they believe a guy can become.
2021 Pro Bowl Vote
It's time to cast your votes for the 2021 Pro Bowl!
Dallas is getting Dalton back for the Minnesota game which should help their chances.
How much will Mike McCarthy's familiarity with Minnesota be an asset?
Anytime you have a familiarity with a defense like Zimmer's, it'll help.
They're really good at disguising stuff and knowing that going in, and potentially getting a veteran QB back to face it, will be big for Dallas.
I was really impressed by AR's comments on how having a role increases buy-in, and can inspire performance beyond expectations.
I don't see him wanting to coach after playing, but I think he could be a good one.
He already is part owner of a pro sports franchise...any chance he will ever get involved in leading from the front offices of a team?
I don't know about that, if by front office you mean GM and building rosters and such.
I could see him going further with the ownership thing, though.
What if anything has AR said about his thought process on the interception on Sunday?
He said on the McAfee show yesterday he was looking to ﻿Equanimeous St. Brown﻿ first and when he came back to MVS on the cross, he didn't see the defender undercutting the route.
Are the Bears going to need to go out and find another quarterback?
It sounds like they're confident Foles will be OK after the bye week, if that's what you mean.
I don't think Trubisky is out for the season, either, with the shoulder.
Of all the players currently on the roster, who do you think are best placed to get the players more energized or do you think this problem is more for the coaches to resolve?
It's on the players.
I believe they'll get it figured out.
With all the injuries every team has to deal with, are you surprised Clay Mathews career seems to have come to an end?
I'm surprised he's not playing somewhere this year, but I don't blame him for not playing if he's not interested in playing for the league minimum.
Maybe that's all he's been offered, I don't know.
It looked like Davante landed pretty hard with all his weight coming down on his elbow/shoulder on that TD catch last week....hopefully all is well for him now that Lazard is back.
That was pretty amazing he could jump that high to haul in that TD on the bad ankle.
Are you feeling good about our prospects in this game?
The Packers are plenty capable of winning this game.
They'll have to play their most complete game of the season in all three phases to do it, and that's a mark they haven't hit yet, which is OK.
It's still November.
It's not just a week to week league for teams, but for players too.
A few weeks ago, Russell Wilson was the unanimous MVP, and 2 losses and 7 turnovers later he's not!
Let the games play out and enjoy watching!
Exactly.
So much can change.
It seems simple, but the thing I miss most this season is the fun, dual, locker room interviews with the Smith Brothers.
That 5-10 minutes of fun and candor always made my week!
There are a lot of things with the media coverage that we all miss this year, but we just have to make the best of it.
While the Packers control their own destiny that doesn't guarantee they'll win every remaining game.
So, for this week, Go Falcons, Go Cardinals, Go Rams, Go Cowboys, and, as always, GO PACK GO!
When we get to December, I'll see about bringing back Path to the Playoffs.
When Hicks pulled up lame with a hamstring Monday night, you could see the holes begin to open for the Vikings run game.
That could be huge for GB in 2 weeks...in my opinion, he and Cook may be the 2 most important divisional players we face
Yeah, Hicks is a stud.
The bye week is at the right time for him.
Having a baby boy and new Packer fan any day now, any advice?
Congratulations in advance, and I'll just say what my father said to me when our first child was on the way: Trust your instincts.
With that I'm going to sign off, folks.
Thanks for all the participation today.
You guys kept the questions coming fast and furious.
Enjoy the game Sunday and we'll talk again next week.
Take care, Mike

packers.com senior writer
Hey everybody, thanks for logging on today.
Go ahead and start sending in your questions and I'll do my best.
Let's get to it.
What, if anything, can these two teams get from practicing against one another last year?
Absolutamente nada, if my long-unused Spanish is correct.
With all the speed demonstrated by the Tampa defense, how often was the hard count cadence tried to slow them down?
﻿Aaron Rodgers tried it quite a bit, during the times he was up to the line early enough with time on the play clock to make the attempt.
The Bucs were well-schooled and didn't bite once that I could see.
Unfortunately, the one time they jumped offside, the officials missed it and the second pick happened.
That should have been either offside or a false start on Billy Turner at RT, but whichever, the pick shouldn't have occurred.
Hi Mike, appreciate your time and insight.
I'm looking forward to seeing Cobb again, albeit in enemy colors.
Have you seen the same quick twitch and strong hands from him this season?
I've only watched a couple of quarters of Texans games so far this year, mostly when they played the Vikings.
I didn't see Cobb do much while I was watching, but what I did see looked like the same tough guy who isn't afraid to go over the middle.
Hey Mike, thanks for doing chat.
I have been hearing everyone talking about the lack of production out of Preston Smith﻿, some are saying he's not in shape, do you agree with this, or did the lack of a pre-season actually hurt him?
I don't have an answer on Preston's productivity being down compared to last year.
I'm curious to hear what his position coach, Mike Smith, will say late tomorrow when he speaks with the media.
Since 2015 the packers are 1-5 after regular season Byes what do you think attributes to the lack of success after byes?
As I said in Inbox earlier this week, I think the opponents are the biggest factor.
Denver in '15, the Rams in '18, SF in '19, TB this year ... all darn good teams, and all those games were on the road.
Hundley was the QB in '17.
The more concerning thing was hearing LaFleur and the players say the practices last week coming out of the bye weren't good.
That definitely plays into it, though I didn't hear LaFleur say that last year after the first SF game.
Mike, thanks for the time.
Defending Watson's mobility and arm strength to me seems similar to preparing for Wilson.
Would preparation (Defense) be much the same?
That's a pretty decent comparison.
Rushing to sack Watson comes with risks, because you can get out of your rush lanes and he can take off.
Rushing/pressuring him to hurry, but with a contain mindset, could be more effective.
What moves are made around the OL if David Bakhtiari has to miss a few games?
Elgton Jenkins﻿, Turner, and even Jon Runyan seem to be pretty versatile around positions.
I really don't know how they'll go about it.
First, we'll see if Bakhtiari can get back on the practice field at some point this week.
If not, we really aren't going to know until the game starts Sunday.
LaFleur didn't reveal his O-line plans during the injuries in September either.
How much attention would the staff be already giving to the Bears?
Zilch.
The Packers have five games between now and the first time they play the Bears.
Hey Mike, We got to see a decent amount of reps from ﻿AJ Dillon﻿ yesterday towards the end of the game.
I thought he had some good runs in that period.
How did you think he did?
Do you think we see more reps out of him down the road this year without it being a blowout?
A popular question.
I thought Dillon did well for himself and he gave the coaching staff something to think about.
Mike, how can the Packers explain the soft coverage and dropping DL in to zone coverage on more than one occasion?
Rushing 2 then 3?
What a mess.
Playing coverage and trying to flood the passing lanes was working against Brady early in the game.
The Bucs did nothing on their first two drives.
But they adjusted and when there was no pressure with the standard four-man rushes later on, that was pretty much it.
Did ﻿Davante Adams﻿ seem at 100 percent?
As close as a guy can be after missing 2 1/2 games and also resting through the bye.
I didn't see any limitations.
Do you see the Packers making any moves before the trade deadline?
Hard to say.
It's not a time traditionally the Packers make any major moves.
I think we'll continue to see steady shuffling of the lower portion of the roster, as is common.
What do you make of the decision to punt instead of going for it in the third quarter in Tampa.
Seems like they threw in the white flag a little to early.
That's a tough one.
The way LaFleur talked about searching for something that could work on the call sheet and getting frustrated, he probably didn't feel good about any play call on fourth-and-8 there.
Often a primary impetus for a head coach to go for it on fourth down in an iffy situation is his confidence in a certain play call.
Mike, do you see the terrible Houston def rankings as more a product of opponents, coaching changes, scheme or personnel?
With that being said is there anyone you see other then JJ Watt that can impact the game on the def side of the ball for the Texans?
Watt and Mercilus are good pass rushers, obviously.
They've played some darn good teams, but that defense also didn't hold up against the Vikings and Minnesota got its first (and only) win down there.
The Packers have to get the offense back on track.
This is a huge opportunity to do so.
Hi Mike, thanks for the chat!
I know things are different this year but is there any intel on how ﻿Jordan Love﻿ is progressing?
Couldn't tell you.
Reporters don't get to see any of the 11-on-11 practice periods during the regular season, when Love would be taking at least some of the scout-team snaps.
Mike, have the Packers blocked a punt, FG or extra point this year?
I don't recall special teams getting one.
Not this year.
Any chance we can get the Packers/Bucs score removed from the main page banner?
It's slightly depressing.
Slightly?
Ha.
I've passed the suggestion along.
I enjoyed the "Rambo" audible Rodgers used Sunday.
Has he called that one before to your recollection?
I'm pretty sure I've heard that one before, but it didn't necessarily mean the same thing.
Do you think ML will mix it up and run some no huddle in the coming weeks?
Perhaps, but you have to pick your spots with that, particularly with the defense coming off a rough game, too.
The offense was humming along pretty good for four games and didn't need to do a lot of up-tempo so I don't anticipate them going crazy with it.
Any word on the return of ﻿Tyler Ervin﻿?
Seems like a pretty important piece!
Again, we'll see if he's back at practice this week.
I thought it was interesting the best run of the game was ﻿Jamaal Williams﻿' 25-yarder in the first quarter off the jet sweep motion by ﻿Aaron Jones﻿, but they only ran the motion a handful of times.
LaFleur said their film study showed the Bucs knew how to defend it.
It's so odd that the Packers have only generated 3 turnovers on defense in 5 games, while winning 4 of them.
What do you think the Packers can do to generate a few more game changing plays?
I wrote about that last week, and it really comes down to taking advantage of the one or two opportunities you're going to get each game.
﻿Adrian Amos﻿ had a great shot at a pick of Brady but missed it.
We talked last week about the two defenders both getting a shot to pick Ryan but it didn't work out.
I think it starts with the pass rush, though.
Pressure is what leads to errant throws most of the time.
Maybe it's time to blitz more?
I think that's totally dependent on the QB you're facing and the WR/DB matchups.
"Yellow Weasel" and "New York Bozo" are the all-timers for Rodgers audibles, though.
Can't help but smile when I hear those.
Classics for sure.
Are you also living in fear of seeing Hingle McCringleberry appear again?
Yeah, I'll pass.
It's been awhile since we've seen a corner like ﻿Jaire Alexander﻿ in Green Bay.
He's the complete package.
The coverage, the athleticism, the ability and desire to make tackles.
I fully believe he's going to start hauling in some of those opportunities (if opposing QBs challenge him).
I do, too, but if he does his job and the QBs are looking elsewhere, then it's on the pass rush to disrupt the QB and make it difficult to go elsewhere.
Enjoyed your response in II regarding the 2nd pick by Rodgers.
I can't help but believe the results would have been different had that not happened.
Momentum just completely switched.
I think all of Packer Nation was as shocked by a second pick as by a pick-six.
It was so out of character for this team, this QB, everything.
As noted before, the really unfortunate thing is if the officials had been on top of things at the snap, the play that resulted in the second pick would have been blown dead.
Our team is 4-1 with me wearing my Kelly Green INDUBITABLY t-shirt, do I rest it for a week or just forge ahead?
Tough one.
Maybe it's just a first-quarter shirt ... first quarter of the season, first quarter of the game ...
What did you make of ﻿Kenny Clark﻿'s return on Sunday?
He wasn't supposed to play as much as he did after such a long layoff, but ﻿Tyler Lancaster﻿'s injury changed those plans.
I saw Clark make some nice plays against the run, but he didn't look like the interior pass rusher we're used to seeing, and I attribute that to having played only 15 snaps this season before Sunday.
He'll find his groove.
You've mentioned that LaFleur went away from presnap motion against Tampa Bay because their defense was adept at defending it.
If that's a strength of our offense, why not force them to go through the high effort required to actually do so?
LaFleur may be asking himself the same question, especially after seeing the 25-yard run by Williams on film and how it opened up.
But he's on to Houston now.
No other way to go about it.
Speaking of turnovers, I have a feeling one game soon they'll come in a bunch.
They've been awfully close on several occasions, and they seem due.
That was the jist of the story I wrote last Thursday.
Maybe I was just a week early.
We'll see.
Mobile QBs are always an issue, but do you think ﻿Krys Barnes﻿ could help with that area of defense?
There's plenty to like about what Barnes has brought to this defense.
Is he fast enough to spy Watson?
We might find out.
Are open roster spots being kept open in hopes that ﻿Kamal Martin﻿ and others may return soon?
I think that's a decent read on things.
But with the Covid protocols about bringing in new players, there may be acquisitions in the works there, too.
I was surprised to read in II that Houston is 3rd in the league in passing yards.
Looks like their 1-5 record is due to their abysmal D?
They've given up at least 28 points in each of their five losses.
Any word on the extent of and prognosis for ﻿Parry Nickerson﻿'s injury?
The press release announcement was pretty sparse.
It's really hard to tell because IR is just a 3-week minimum this year and there's no limit on how many guys can be brought back.
If we can't get organized in 25 seconds why speed it up and go no huddle just to go no huddle?
I think that's a valid point.
Depth at CB with ﻿Kevin King﻿ being down really seems to be an issue?
Thoughts?
It's tough for any team to replace one of its top two corners for a game.
The Packers have faced other defenses dealing with the same thing, and the Vikings had to replace three of their top four corners from the start of the year and look where that defense is.
You could see even back in 2018 when Alexander and King were on the field together, this defense was different.
I don't think that's changed.
Sounds like this week should be a great opportunity to re-establish the running game based on the Texans' D rankings.
I don't care whether the Packers do it running or passing, they just have to get their rhythm back.
But yes, the Texans have struggled to stop the run.
Contain Watson on D and throw it all over h_ll on O, we win.
It's going to take 4 quarters.
Houston proved that last week.
Tennessee had them down 21-7 in the second quarter and then had to rally late to get the game to OT.
Do you think the current Covid rules will be retained?
Example: 3-week IR in which any player can come back.
16-person practice squad, etc.
I doubt they'll be retained as-is, but maybe with some modifications.
The league has always been careful about providing opportunities for players to be "stashed" on IR so they don't have to be exposed to waivers to get jobs elsewhere.
This year obviously a lot of restrictions have been set aside due to the pandemic, but they don't want long-term rules that could be abused.
Regarding no huddle comments, how about just snapping the ball with maybe 10 seconds on the play clock to change it up.
It always seems to be at one second and the defense can plan for the snap.
That remains a work in progress.
It seemed clear this past game that the play call wasn't getting in very quickly -- I referenced earlier LaFleur's frustrations with trying to find something, and an extra 3-4 seconds to make the decision on the call can have an impact.
That also affects how much time you have to run presnap motions too.
Any unexpected predictions for this week's games?
I'm not into predictions as many of you know, but it's an interesting slate of games.
Steelers-Ravens, Seahawks-Cardinals, 49ers-Patriots, Bucs-Raiders, Bears-Rams on Monday night.
Should be some entertaining stuff.
With that I have to sign off folks.
Thanks for the participation and we'll talk again next week.
Take care and stay safe.
Best, Mike

GREEN BAY – Having grown up inside the Philadelphia Eagles' locker room, it's only fitting ﻿Jon Runyan﻿'s first NFL start may come this Sunday against his childhood team.
As the son of the former Pro Bowl right tackle and beloved Eagle who carries the same name, Runyan has deep roots in the Philadelphia area.
He followed his dad to practice, knew the name of practically every player on the Eagles' roster and played high school football at St. Joseph's Prep in North Philly.
And now, it's brought the younger Runyan to this point – a rookie offensive lineman who has performed admirably for the Packers in spot duty this season.
A bulk of his of 156 offensive snaps have come the past two weeks, having been pressed into action at left guard due to the domino effect of ﻿Elgton Jenkins﻿ filling in for injured center ﻿Corey Linsley﻿, who exited with a knee injury in Sunday's 41-25 win over Chicago and hasn't practiced yet this week.
A sixth-round pick out of Michigan this past April, Runyan was keenly aware his childhood team would be traveling to Lambeau Field in Week 13.
What he couldn't have predicted is the fact he likely will start his first NFL game against his dad's former team.
"It's one of those games that I'm excited to get the opportunity to play in," Runyan said.
"It's a team that I always watched ever since I was like 3 years old and pretty much all the way up until last year.
… Now, I'm over here and I gotta handle my business and everybody knows where my allegiance stands.
"It's just like every other game but it's a little extra special I'm playing against a team I grew up watching."
The Packers' offensive line has drawn praise this year for not only how well it's protected quarterback ﻿Aaron Rodgers﻿ – he's on pace to be sacked a career-low 16 times this year – but also how malleable it's been when injuries have hit.
Starting right guard ﻿Lane Taylor﻿ was lost for the season due to a knee injury in Week 1, which resulted in Runyan seeing his first offensive snaps in the Packers' opener against Minnesota.
Left tackle ﻿David Bakhtiari﻿ missed three games with a rib injury, right tackle ﻿Billy Turner﻿ sat out early in the year with a knee and Linsley could very well see his streak of 68 consecutive regular-season starts come to an end this Sunday against Philadelphia.
However the offensive line has shifted to compensate for anyone it's missing, the end result often has been Runyan subbing in at one of the two guard positions.
If there are two definitive traits father passed down to son, it's steadiness and professionalism.
After Sunday's 41-25 win over Chicago, quarterback Aaron Rodgers referred to Runyan as "Mr.
Reliable" for how he's performed in a pinch this season.
"You need the depth in this league, you see it every year," said Rodgers on Wednesday.
"It's hard to have all 16 games with your starting five so I'm really proud of Jon.
"I'm not surprised.
Obviously, he's got the pedigree.
His dad played a long time and was a great player in the league, but Jon has a good mindset when he's out there."
Although Runyan takes his cues from position coach Adam Stenavich, his dad has chimed in with a few helpful tips here and there.
As the NFL vice president of the policy and rules administration, the elder Runyan typically has his hands full with league matters during the season.
He still finds time, though, to watch his Jon Jr.'s film and send encouraging text messages before and after his son's games.
While Runyan is proving there's more to his game than his last name, there was one eye-opening moment last month when Runyan crossed paths with quarterback Tom Brady after the Packers played in Tampa Bay.
Brady, now in his 21st NFL season, actually was teammates with Jon Sr. at Michigan.
Runyan had met Brady a few times, including once when the future Hall of Famer was on hand to watch Michigan play Colorado in 2016, so he figured he'd say hello.
"I didn't think that he'd recognize my face but after I introduced who I was, he was pretty excited to see me," Runyan said.
"He told me to tell my father hello, give him his regards and hope my family's doing all right.
It was a pretty cool moment that I didn't expect for it to blow up.
I just wanted to say hi to Tom because he's my dad's friend."
On the field, Runyan has made a seamless transition from being an All-Big Ten left tackle to playing in the interior despite not having a physical offseason program, and then a truncated training camp.
Runyan credits his fellow linemen for making it easy on him, but Stenavich also cites his preparation and work ethic as reasons his rookie lineman has been able to quickly get up to speed.
The reputation gives the Packers the utmost confidence in Runyan regardless of the circumstances or game situation.
"I think you find out a lot about guys when you get in the heat of a battle," Head Coach Matt LaFleur said.
"Do they give the deer-in-headlights look or do they just not flinch and not blink and just go about their business?
That's what he's been able to do.
"Certainly he's been around the game for a really long time with his dad, but he's just able to transfer what he does in practice onto the game field."

GREEN BAY – Whether it was Andre Rison in 1996 or Howard Green in 2010, there have been several in-season waivers claims who went on to play a pivotal part in a Packers Super Bowl run.
This season, Green Bay is hopeful Damon "Snacks" Harrison could be the next veteran acquisition to put a team with championship aspirations over the top.
The Packers officially claimed the former All-Pro defensive tackle off waivers from Seattle on Thursday.
Since he'd been in the Seahawks' COVID-19 testing pool, ﻿Damon Harrison﻿ was eligible to practice with the Packers once he passed his physical and could even play as soon as this Sunday in Chicago.
Harrison, 32, has long been regarded as one of the NFL's top run-stuffers.
The 6-foot-3, 339-pound defensive tackle has tallied 494 tackles and 11 sacks over 123 regular-season games (111 starts) with the New York Jets, Giants, Detroit and Seattle.
"What we've heard is that he's a really intelligent guy," Head Coach Matt LaFleur said on Thursday morning.
"He's going to be a guy who I think can give us a lot in terms of playing the nose.
He's a really good run defender and he has been for a really long time.
Just excited to get him in the building."
The Packers have been looking to add a fifth defensive lineman to their rotation since ﻿Montravius Adams﻿' nagging toe injury landed him on injured reserve in November, and they appear to have found their man in the veteran affectionately known as "Snacks."
Defensive coordinator Mike Pettine has firsthand experience with Harrison.
He held the same position with the Jets during Harrison's rookie year in 2012.
It was in New York Harrison earned his nickname, given to him by former Jets coach Rex Ryan and defensive line coach Karl Dunbar.
While Harrison only played five games that year, Pettine saw the promise in the former William Penn standout.
"He was very entertaining as a rookie.
I'll put it that way," Pettine said.
"But we knew right from the jump that this small-school guy just had something to him.
And obviously that's been proven now for a long time.
"We're excited about having him here and hopefully we can make a run and he'll be a part of it."
Harrison earned All-Pro recognition in his first season with the Giants in 2016 and continued to be a productive run-stuffer during a 1½-year stint in Detroit, including a sack of ﻿Aaron Rodgers﻿ in Green Bay last October.
Harrison sat out the early part of the 2020 season before signing to Seattle's practice squad in early October.
He was added to the Seahawks' roster a month later and recorded nine tackles and a forced fumble, playing 59 defensive snaps over six games, before receiving his release on Tuesday.
Packers defensive tackle ﻿Kenny Clark﻿ saw on Twitter Wednesday night Green Bay had claimed Harrison off waivers and immediately took to his own account to express his excitement for the veteran's arrival.
"(I'm) glad that he's here and I get a chance to learn from him," said Clark on Thursday.
"He's been a guy that's been playing at a high level since he entered the league and been one of the best nose tackles to play.
So, excited to get a chance to talk to him, pick his brain and play with him."
The defensive front is coming off arguably its best performance of the season during last Sunday's 40-14 win over the Tennessee Titans.
Green Bay held All-Pro running back Derrick Henry to just 98 rushing yards on 23 carries, while sacking Ryan Tannehill three times and helping force two interceptions.
As well as the defense has played the run over the past month, the Packers have done it with a short rotation of Clark, ﻿Dean Lowry﻿, ﻿Kingsley Keke﻿ and ﻿Tyler Lancaster﻿ on the D-line.
Bringing in Harrison is almost a callback to the Packers' 2010 Super Bowl push when the veteran Green was claimed off waivers to join Ryan Pickett and B.J.
Raji on the line.
When injuries have flared up, General Manager Brian Gutekunst hasn't been shy about seeking outside help.
He claimed tackle Jared Veldheer and running back/returner ﻿Tyler Ervin﻿ during the final stretch of last season, and he signed defensive lineman ﻿Billy Winn﻿ (currently on IR) and receiver/returner ﻿Tavon Austin﻿ this year.
On the eve of the playoffs, the Packers have done it again with the addition of Harrison.
"I know what he's all about as a player.
He's always been a problem to block," LaFleur said.
"Obviously Gutey was all over it, and our scouting department, that's a big-time pickup for us, especially this late in the season."

Tom from Pine River, WI
Responding to your post last week on great Packers runs.
In 1963, Tom Moore, filling in for Paul Hornung, had a nice 77-yard touchdown run against the Lions breaking a number of tackles.
Tom, thanks for the video.
Great memory.
And I think it's an understatement to call it merely a nice run.
No.
1, the Lions had the second-best rushing defense in the league that season behind only the NFL champion Bears.
No.
2, watching Moore run through a tackle attempt close to 20 yards up field almost immediately after spinning out of the grasp of the first would-be tackler was truly impressive.
Plus, his vision and acceleration jumped out at the start of the run when he cut back inside pulling guard Jerry Kramer and burst to daylight.
Click here for a video clip of the run.
Moore has become a somewhat forgotten figure from the Lombardi era, but he was a big, strong, fast back.
What's more, Lombardi thought so highly of him that he considered switching back to his three-back offense that he had used in New York and for the first half of his first season in Green Bay.
The Packers selected Moore with the fifth pick of the 1960 draft, which gives him the distinction of being the answer to this trivia question.
Who was the only No.
1 draft pick made by Vince Lombardi in tandem with top scout Jack Vainisi?
That also was the draft where landslide Heisman Trophy winner Billy Cannon of LSU went No.
1.
Like Cannon, Moore played in the SEC at Vanderbilt, and Lombardi liked him better because he was bigger and faster.
Moore was 6-foot-2, 215 pounds and, according to his personnel report, which is still on file in our offices, ran a 10.1 100-yard dash coming out of college.
In fact, Lombardi claimed he was even faster.
"(Moore) runs the 100 in less than 10 seconds," Lombardi said at the time.
"He has great moves and cuts.
Billy Cannon was perhaps the finest college football player in the country last fall, but Moore is more our kind of player."
As a rookie, Moore led the NFL in kickoff returns with a 33.1 average.
He also averaged 5.3 yards per carry as Paul Hornung's backup.
As a result, up until two days before the start of training camp, Lombardi contemplated going back to a full-house backfield so he could play Moore regularly.
"We have three great running backs in Moore, Taylor and Hornung," Lombardi said in mid-March as he was deliberating over his options.
"Great" was not a word Lombardi tossed around loosely, but he used it several times that offseason to describe Moore's potential.
In the end, Lombardi scrapped the idea because it would have forced him to flank Hornung, the left halfback, in formations where the right halfback and fullback were alone in the backfield.
Lombardi decided that would have been a waste of Hornung's talents.
Instead, Lombardi used Moore as a backup for both Hornung and Taylor.
In 1963, when Hornung was suspended for the season, Moore took his place and finished second to Taylor in team rushing with 658 yards and a 5-yard average.
He also finished fourth in receiving with 23 catches and a 10.3 average.
At that point, Moore was widely considered the best backup halfback in the league, partly because of his big-play ability.
The records died with the game, but in the Runner-up Bowl following the 1963 season, Moore circled out of the backfield and turned a short Bart Starr pass into a 99-yard touchdown in a victory over Cleveland.
But by 1965, Moore fell into Lombardi's doghouse.
He injured his foot and it went undiagnosed back before CT scans and MRIs.
Thus, Moore's injury remained a mystery to him and the Packers' medical staff.
"My foot just started hurting," Moore told me in a 2003 interview.
"I could still run to some degree.
But late in the year when the ground was hard, it was just so painful.
When I tried to run, cut and turn corners, it was like somebody was trying to stab (me) in the foot.
I never got my speed back after that."
Hornung was injured for much of the year and Lombardi was unforgiving when Moore wasn't available to take his place, especially with an injury he couldn't comprehend.
Pat Peppler, the Packers' personnel director, told me years later that he realized before the season was over that Moore's days were numbered.
"I remember an instance when (Lombardi) called for Tom to go in and (the trainer) came over and said, 'He can't go,'" said Peppler.
"Vince went over to him and said, 'Damn it, every time I want you, you're hurt.'
I thought, 'Oh, oh.'"
Moore was well aware of Lombardi's intolerance about injuries.
Earlier in his career, he had broken his wrist in training camp and the doctors casted it.
When Lombardi spotted the cast that evening, he called the doctors and ordered it removed.
Moore was given a leather wrap to put around his wrist and played through the injury.
Prior to the 1965 season, Lombardi had drafted halfback Donny Anderson as a first-round future and then after that season drafted fullback Jim Grabowski No.
1.
Now deep in running backs, Lombardi traded Moore to the Rams for quarterback Ron Smith and a draft choice.
Smith and tackle Dick Arndt, the draft pick, didn't pan out in Green Bay; and Moore never recovered, averaging 2.6 yards per carry in his one year with the Rams.
Clearly, there was no winner in the trade, but Lombardi fleeced first-year coach George Allen in a way not many others did in future years.
He had peddled him damaged goods.
It's interesting that Elijah Pitts and Travis Williams, two other halfbacks who played for Lombardi, have been elected to the Packers Hall of Fame, but not Moore.
Pitts played behind Moore from 1961-64 and rushed for only 1,684 yards with the Packers, whereas Moore's total was 2,069.
Williams' rushing total in Green Bay was 1,063.
Granted, he made the Packers Hall of Fame more as a kick returner, but even there his average in Green Bay was 26.7, only slightly better than Moore's 26.5 average on just six fewer returns.

What was Veryl Switzer's number and how many years did he play for the Packers?
Switzer, who wore No.
27, is the answer to another trivia question: Who was the first African-American player drafted by the Packers in the first round?
Similar to Moore, Switzer had a star-crossed career.
Selected with the fourth overall choice in the 1954 draft, he played just two years, mostly on offense, although doubling as a defensive back in a pinch.
In fact, his first extended action as a rookie was on defense.
Against the Bears in the second game of the season, he was in on eight tackles.
Switzer played during the 11-year stretch, pre-Lombardi, where the Packers didn't have a winning season.
But with Lisle Blackbourn, an old-school taskmaster with an eye for talent, as his coach, the Packers were at least competitive during Switzer's two seasons.
In '54, they were 4-8, but seven of their losses were by a total of 35 points.
The next year, they were 6-6.
Although Switzer had big-play ability, his playing time on offense was limited because he shared the right halfback position with Al Carmichael, another former No.
1 draft pick.
In fact, they also shared kick return duties and both ranked among the best in the league.
For example, Switzer led the NFL in punt returns as a rookie with a 12.8 average, including a 93-yard return against the Bears.
On kickoff returns, he ranked seventh and sixth in the league in his two years.
As a right halfback, Switzer often lined up as a flanker and was used as much as a receiver as he was a runner, catching a total of 31 passes.
Yet he also averaged 5.2 yards on 31 rushes and was considered an outstanding blocker.
Popular with his teammates, Switzer was the first Black player to make Green Bay his year-round home.
He worked for Farah's Liquor in the offseason as an in-store salesman and also did promotional work in the Green Bay area.
After his second season, Switzer, a lieutenant in the Air Corps Reserve, was ordered to report to Lackland Air Force Base in Texas to learn to become a pilot.
After two seasons of active duty, Switzer returned in 1958 and was cut late in camp by Scooter McLean.
He played three more years in the Canadian Football League and then went back to Kansas State, his alma mater, where he held a number of administrative and athletic department jobs.
Switzer also was a charter inductee, along with Lynn Dickey, in the school's Hall of Fame and football ring of honor.

What can you tell me about a lineman named Ruetz, who played for the Packers in the early 1950s?
Howie Ruetz was a 6-3, 250-pound defensive tackle who played from 1951-53.
But he's probably best remembered for his bloodlines.
A Racine, Wis., native, Howie was a high school standout there at St. Catherine's and then played at Loras College in Dubuque, Iowa.
After being drafted by the Los Angeles Rams in the 26th round in 1951, Ruetz was cut only two weeks before the season started and claimed by the Packers.
The Rams were loaded with talent at the time and won the NFL title that year.
Ruetz appeared in all 12 games for the Packers as a rookie, but then in only eight his final two seasons.
His father, George "Babe" Ruetz, was more famous.
Babe managed and coached the Racine team that played in the NFL from 1922-24 and again in 1926, and was one of the Packers' first big rivals.
In fact, Ruetz was running the team in 1921 when it played an independent schedule and faced the Packers for the mythical state championship in Milwaukee on Dec. 4.
That was the game where the Packers paid three University of Notre Dame players under-the-table money and played them under assumed names, only to get caught and briefly thrown out of what soon became the NFL.
The game ended in a 3-3 tie, but drew a big crowd and paved the way for Ruetz to get his team into the three-year-old league.
Ruetz was in Canton, Ohio, at the Jan. 28, 1922 league meeting, seeking a franchise for Racine, on behalf of the local American Legion club, when the Packers were expelled for using ineligible players.
He also was at the meeting in Cleveland on June 24, 1922, the day Racine was granted a franchise and Green Bay was readmitted.
At first, it was believed Racine would be given Green Bay's spot in the league.
But as it turned out, Ruetz supported the Packers' efforts to be reinstated, figuring their games would continue to draw large crowds and make money.
In its first three NFL seasons, the Racine Legion compiled a 14-11-6 record under Ruetz and was 2-3-1 against the Packers.
On Jan. 20, 1923, at another NFL meeting in Chicago, it appears that Ruetz might have done the Packers another big favor.
The private, badly underfunded Green Bay Football Club organized by Curly Lambeau, George Calhoun, Nate Abrams and Joe Ordens suffered heavy financial losses that again put the Green Bay franchise at risk.
But Ruetz moved at that meeting to transfer the franchise into the name of the "Green Bay Football Corporation," which technically didn't exist yet but was trying to raise money through a public stock sale to save the team.
After three seasons, the Legion was broke and unable to field a team in 1925.
Following a reorganization, Racine was readmitted to the NFL in 1926 under the name Racine Tornadoes.
But the season turned out to be a disaster on and off the field.
In fact, Racine played its last NFL game on Oct. 24, 1926, losing to the Packers, 35-0, at old City Stadium and folded with a 1-4 record.
Howie Ruetz was born in August 1927, three months after his dad had died.
Howie died in 1999.

In the moments following the end of the NFC Championship Game in January, Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers openly wondered about the immediate future for himself and many of his teammates in Green Bay.
The bitter end to a magical season still fresh, Rodgers was right to wonder if his team would look much different to start the 2021 season.
“Just the uncertainties is tough and the finality of it,” Rodgers said.
A complicated salary cap situation and several players with expiring contracts made for plenty of uncertainty.
Despite the challenges, Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst didn’t gut his team.
Instead, he went out of his way – using rarely-used salary cap tricks, at least for the Packers – to bring back nearly every significant contributor from the 2020 team, giving Rodgers a chance to run it back with a roster that won 13 games and produced the No.
1 scoring offense in football a year ago.
In just the last month, the Packers re-signed running back Aaron Jones, cornerback Kevin King, tight end Marcedes Lewis, defensive lineman Tyler Lancaster and safety Will Redmond.
They restructured deals for six different veterans, including edge rusher Preston Smith.
Restricted tenders were issued to tight end Robert Tonyan and cornerback Chandon Sullivan.
Receiver Allen Lazard received an exclusive rights tender.
The work probably isn’t done, but the Packers’ core from 2020 is almost nearly intact.
Center Corey Linsley, right tackle Rick Wagner, running back Jamaal Williams and linebacker Christian Kirksey will be the only significant departures.
The exodus could have featured a much longer list and reshaped the look of the 2021 team.
A nearly-intact roster will provide what could be a final opportunity for this collection of players to achieve the ultimate goal.
The Packers will return 15 of their top 18 players in offensive snaps, 15 of their top 16 players in defensive snaps and their top 14 players in special teams snaps.
If safety Raven Greene is re-signed at some point, the Packers will have back 18 of their top 19 players on defense and their top 16 players on special teams.
Given the team’s previous moves, Greene not returning would be a minor surprise.
The Packers were good enough to win the Super Bowl last season.
This was a team that earned the top seed in the NFC, led the league in scoring, had the NFL’s MVP at quarterback and hosted the NFC title game.
A poorly-played game at home against a similarly-talented foe robbed the Packers of a chance to play in the Super Bowl.
This offseason could have provided a pivot point for Gutekunst and the Packers.
With so many free agents and a cap situation in need of fixing, a chance to reset the roster and chart a different path for the future was possible.
The Packers picked running it back with the 2020 roster.
This will be last year’s team plus rookie supplements and maybe a veteran or two added late in the free agency process.
Change is coming in 2022 – there’s almost no way around it, regardless of the quarterback situation.
But with almost all the major cast members back, the 2021 team will get a real chance to finish what last year’s team couldn’t.

Free agent offensive lineman Lane Taylor visited his second team since the start of the new league year.
According to the league's transaction wire, Taylor – a starter for the Green Bay Packers to open the 2020 season – visited the Houston Texans on Monday.
Taylor visited the San Francisco 49ers last month.
Both teams likely want to check in on his recovery from the ACL injury he suffered in Week 1 of last year.
Taylor took a pay cut and returned to the Packers in 2020, and a strong summer earned him the starting job at right guard.
He was lost...
Daniel Jeremiah's latest mock draft for NFL.com has the Green Bay Packers getting help for the interior of the offensive line in the first round.
Jeremiah sent Alabama offensive lineman Landon Dickerson to the Packers at No.
29 overall.
From Jeremiah: "Dickerson is the best pure interior offensive linemen available.
I thought he might fall out of the first round after his ACL injury, but it appears his recovery is going smoothly.
He can step in following the departure of Corey Linsley."
Dickerson is Jeremiah's No.
40 overall prospect in the draft class, mostly due to injuries.

How did Rodgers do during his opening appearance?
It's time to go to the tape to evaluate the performance.
Here's a light-hearted breakdown of Rodgers' first episode as guest host (note: spoilers ahead):
– Solid intro.
Looks confident, ready for the moment.
Possibly too much swaying back and forth.
He might be fighting some nerves, and that's just fine.

Packers President/CEO
On the first Saturday of every month, Mark will write about a topic of interest to Packers fans and the organization, and then answer five fan questions.
Fans are encouraged to email Mark with their name and hometown at: MurphyTakes5@packers.com.
Last year, in the February MT5 column, I wrote that the loss to the 49ers in the NFC Championship Game was a disappointing ending to a very successful season.
Although both seasons ended with losses in the NFC Championship Game, I think this year's ending was even more disappointing for a number of reasons.
First, although we had the same record as last year's team, this year's team was better.
We had the league's top scoring offense, with ﻿Aaron Rodgers﻿ playing at an MVP level.
Our defense made great strides in the second half of the season, and we were stopping the run better than in 2019.
Also, we were the No.
1 seed (and the only team in the NFC with a bye) and played the NFC Championship Game at Lambeau Field.
In addition, this year's game was much closer.
Last year, the game was really over at halftime.
This year, although we were down 28-10 early in the third quarter, we fought back and had a chance to win the game in the fourth quarter.
That's part of what made this loss so disappointing.
We were in a position to win, but were not able to make the plays needed to win.
It is easy to think of things that we could have done differently that would have led to a win.
As a result, it has taken me, our players and fans a long time to get over the loss.
I'm very proud of this year's team, though, and thought we had a great season.
I was especially proud of how we handled the pandemic.
I think we all will learn from this year's experience and I'm confident that we will be able to continue to compete for championships in the future.
Now, on to your questions…
Dan from Minneapolis
There have been comments in the national sporting press regarding the Packers' incentive as a publicly owned organization to go all-in to win a Super Bowl.
The general contention is that the coffers are full, based on ticket and merchandise sales, national TV appearances, the Titletown development, etc.
That the Packers really don't have much of an incentive to position and commit for a Super Bowl run, when playoff appearances every other year or so would serve the organization just as well.
That it takes an invested owner to drive an NFL organization to do the things necessary to win Super Bowls.
I wanted to give you the opportunity to comment on this impression.
Thanks for taking these questions on a monthly basis!
I'm glad you brought this up, Dan.
I have seen similar comments over the years, that the Packers would be better off with a rich, powerful owner.
In my mind, nothing could be further from the truth.
We have all the resources we need to win Super Bowls and have consistently been in a position to compete for a championship over the last decade.
I don't think our ownership structure hurts us at all in this regard.
I would say, though, that both Ted Thompson and Brian Gutekunst have believed in building a championship team while also building for the future (as evidenced by the drafting of both Aaron Rodgers and ﻿Jordan Love﻿), but this has nothing to do with our structure.
Sam from Charlottesville, VA
Why did the Packers choose to kick a field goal with such little time left in the Buccaneers game?
You can't give the ball to Tom Brady and expect with so little time left to even get the ball back!
We deserve better!
For years I've waited for another Packers Super Bowl and we came so close two years in a row.
It hardly seemed we were trying to call good plays!
This was one of the decisions that I referred to above, Sam.
The decision to kick the field goal was one of those 50-50 calls – if it works out you look like a genius and if it fails you will be second-guessed.
The situation was fourth-and-goal at the 8-yard line, and we had just thrown three incomplete passes.
We had three timeouts remaining and the two-minute warning (four chances to stop the clock…the Bucs' kick returner actually did us a favor by giving himself up before the game clock hit two minutes).
Our defense had played better in the second half (three interceptions).
Also, even if we had scored a touchdown on the fourth-and-goal (and whether or not we converted the two-point conversion), our defense still would have had to stop the Bucs.
These types of decisions are why being a head coach in the NFL is such a challenging job.
A question from Craig
Mark, it would be great to hear an explanation why the team disrespected our flag and stood inside for the NFC Championship Game.
Not sure who you answer to but last time I checked the team is owned by a significant number of stockholders that deserve an explanation.
It was a poor decision in my view!
What did all the millionaires playing a game decide on to do this moronic act?
Maybe if they wake up and do some research they will see that the bull---- Black Lives Matter movement is a front for the Democratic National Committee and not one dime they donate or pretend to donate goes to anything that helps the inner cities many of these athletes come from.
I am more than anxious to get an explanation from you.
You are the head of the franchise and poor decisions like this need to be explained.
Not sure why it is that the visiting team had the courage to do what is right and realize the flag represents what it is that gives all you the opportunity to sit in your overpaid positions.
I hope you have another record year of dismal earnings if this crap continues.
20 years in the military.
Seen many young men and women sacrifice a lot for that flag and you morons take it upon yourselves to disrespect it.
Why don't you bring a few wounded warriors in to explain this to your overpaid athletes?
Thanks for raising this issue, Craig.
Actually, our team had been staying in the locker room for the entire season.
The NFC Championship Game was the first time that TV showed the national anthem.
Our players decided to stay in the locker room this season to bring attention to the systemic racism that still exists in our country, and in no way did they mean any disrespect to the flag or the military.
They wanted to act in unison, and thought it was better to stay in the locker room than to come out for the national anthem and have some players kneel and others stand.
Our veterans fought and sacrificed to ensure that people, like our players, would have the right to express their views.
Markus and Eileen from Aurora, CO
Dear Mark, what a season!
Sadly, Packer backers including shareholders suffered a double heartbreak in January: Ted Thompson's passing and the gut-wrenching loss in the home NFC Championship Game.
Looking at how 2020 went, I am excited looking for things to come in 2021, including hopefully an in-person shareholder meeting.
Thank you for all the work you and everyone else is doing for the organization!
GO PACK GO!
Thanks so much, Markus and Eileen.
It was a tough week for Packers fans.
Ted Thompson meant so much to this organization.
It was an honor to work with him, and I learned so much from him.
His imprint was all over this team – I was hoping that we would win the Super Bowl so that people would realize all the great things Ted did over the years in building the team.
Next season, we will put Ted's name up in the stadium bowl to recognize all that he did for the organization.
This will be a great tribute to Ted, and I'm glad that we were able to communicate our plans to Ted and his family before he died.
A question from Randy
Hello Mark, thanks for reading my email.
Though the season didn't end how most of us imagined, it still was an exciting year for the Packers, coming up just short of the Super Bowl.
Congratulations to the coaches and players for navigating COVID.
It was amazing there were only a couple of players who missed time because of the virus.
My question deals with what you foresee as the biggest challenges the Packers face this offseason?
The salary cap certainly is one of them, but here must be a few others you and the organization will need to face.
Thanks, Randy.
I appreciate your comments regarding how well our team handled the pandemic.
This is a real tribute to our coaches and players.
Most of the challenges that I see us facing this year are related to the pandemic.
You mentioned the salary cap.
The cap hasn't been officially set yet for the 2021 season, but the league and the NFLPA have agreed that it will be no lower than $176M (down from $198.2M in 2020).
If the cap ends up being $176M (the league and the PA will set the new cap by the start of the new league year of March 17) the Packers (and almost every team) will have to make numerous difficult decisions to get under the salary cap.
The moves could include cutting players or restructuring players' contracts.
Another challenge we will face this year is attempting to evaluate potential draft picks and undrafted free agents without the combine and visits that have been common in the past.
Although the NFL Draft was held virtually last year, the combine was held in normal fashion in Indianapolis.
Also, a challenge for us this year, with new defensive and special teams coordinators, will be implementing new systems when most of our contact with players this offseason is likely to be virtual.

GREEN BAY – For all the questions the Packers have regarding their offensive line heading into 2021, one of the answers might be ﻿Jon Runyan﻿.
The sixth-round draft pick out of Michigan didn't start a game as a rookie last year, but by getting thrown into the fire on multiple occasions and holding his own – at a new position, no less – Runyan has the decision-makers considering him for a bigger role this season.
"Jon did a really good job in the opportunities he had last year to play," General Manager Brian Gutekunst said last week regarding Runyan's ability to become a starter in Year 2 if called upon.
"He certainly gives you a lot of confidence that he could do that."
It's too early to tell how it's all going to shake out.
The uncertainty with the Packers' offensive line stems from All-Pro left tackle ﻿David Bakhtiari﻿'s rehab from an ACL tear and All-Pro center ﻿Corey Linsley﻿'s pending free agency.
If Linsley leaves and Bakhtiari isn't ready by Week 1 – which would constitute a miraculous recovery from the late-December injury, though no one is counting a dedicated pro like Bakhtiari out at this stage – the Packers' four most experienced offensive linemen as of now would be ﻿Billy Turner﻿, ﻿Elgton Jenkins﻿, ﻿Lucas Patrick﻿ and Runyan.
Adding a veteran in free agency and/or targeting a high-round draft pick who could potentially start right away is certainly on the radar, so the extent of the Packers' options for the starting five remains to be determined.
But it's a good bet Runyan will be very much in the mix after his solid work off the bench last season.
Not including late-game kneel-downs, Runyan took snaps at both right and left guard in five different games.
Those outings included the fourth quarter of the opener at Minnesota, which were his first NFL game snaps of any kind following a training camp without a preseason.
His most extensive work came in three games in November, all at left guard.
After playing the entire second half at San Francisco, he entered early in back-to-back games against Indianapolis and Chicago when Jenkins moved from left guard to center to replace an injured Linsley.
Runyan played 50 snaps in each of those two games and held up well.
There were thoughts he might stay in the starting lineup when Linsley missed the next three games, but the coaches opted to go with more experience, moving Turner from right tackle back to guard and inserting veteran Rick Wagner in Turner's spot.
Be that as it may, the decision did not reflect any dissatisfaction with Runyan, and Wagner has since been released, changing the dynamic for 2021.
"It wasn't too big for him," offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett said of Runyan stepping in as a rookie.
"There wasn't that wide-open-eyed look.
You can't coach that.
I think that's something that comes natural to a player."
Perhaps his pedigree as the namesake son of a 14-year NFL pro and Philadelphia Eagles icon had something to do with that.
But it's also a credit to Runyan's adaptability and feel for the game, turning himself from a two-time All-Big Ten tackle into an NFL guard rather seamlessly.
The Packers pegged him as a guard during the pre-draft process last year, and Runyan tackled the challenge of the switch like a pro from Day 1.
The virtual-only offseason didn't prove to be the hindrance it might've been for other rookies, and his work in spot duty as the year went along drew public praise from both Head Coach Matt LaFleur and MVP QB ﻿Aaron Rodgers﻿.
Now, with the redshirt fully burned and the Packers sorting out over the next couple of months what their offensive line will look like, Runyan could be penciled in as a starter for the first 11-on-11 reps this spring or summer, whenever they may be.
It'll constitute yet another proving ground for the young pro, but there's little doubt he'll be ready for it.
"Until these guys have to do it on a day-in and day-out basis, you never really know," Gutekunst said.
"Can they hold up?
Can they do it that way consistently for a long period of time?
"But at the same time I think the way he's wired, the way he approaches his business, and the way he's gone about it so far gives us a lot of confidence that he can be one of those guys."

The Green Bay Packers signed LS Joe Fortunato.
The transaction was announced Wednesday by General Manager Brian Gutekunst.
Fortunato (for-chuh-nah-doe), a 6-4, 240-pound, first-year player out of the University of Delaware, was originally signed by the Indianapolis Colts as an undrafted free agent in 2017.
He also spent some time with the Dallas Cowboys during the 2020 offseason.
The former walk-on for the Blue Hens became a four-year letterwinner (2012-15), playing in 46 contests.
He served as the snapper on punts for four seasons and the snapper on placements for his final two years.

On the first Saturday of every month, Mark will write about a topic of interest to Packers fans and the organization, and then answer five fan questions.
Fans are encouraged to email Mark with their name and hometown at: MurphyTakes5@packers.com.
Week 12 of this year's NFL schedule had to be one of the strangest in the history of the league.
It started with three games scheduled on Thanksgiving – including the traditional home games in Detroit and Dallas.
The Steelers were scheduled to host the Ravens on Thanksgiving night.
However, that game, due to an outbreak in the Ravens' facility, was rescheduled to Sunday afternoon, then Tuesday night and then finally Wednesday afternoon.
Yes, the first-ever Wednesday afternoon game, making last week the longest week in NFL history.
COVID-19 is also testing the flexibility and creativity of each team.
Due to a backup quarterback testing positive and contact tracing determining that all their quarterbacks had met without masks, the Broncos were forced to play the Saints without a quarterback.
Wide receiver Kendall Hinton, an undrafted rookie who played quarterback early in his career at Wake Forest, played quarterback for the Broncos.
Unfortunately, the results were predictable, with the Saints (who played without starting quarterback Drew Brees) winning 31-3, and with Hinton completing one pass and throwing two interceptions.
It's never a good sign when you have more interceptions than completions.
The league also closed all club facilities on Monday and Tuesday to avoid a spread of the virus following Thanksgiving.
Finally, due to regulations in Santa Clara County, the 49ers will be the Arizona 49ers for the rest of the season.
As we head into Week 13 of the NFL schedule (there was no Thursday night game this week due to rescheduling related to the Ravens-Steelers game), a total of 18 games have been postponed or rescheduled.
Significantly, though, none have been cancelled.
With teams no longer having any byes, it will be more challenging for the league going forward to find spots to move games.
Given this, it is imperative that all teams strictly follow the league's protocols.
It has certainly been a strange year, and it hasn't always been fair to teams, but the best teams will be the ones that are resilient, flexible and follow the protocols.
Now, on to your questions…
A question from David
Way to go, Murph!
In midst of the worst pandemic in America our city has an alarming infection rate.
The media begs us to not spend the holiday with our loved ones.
They urge us not to go to bars and restaurants.
Our health care providers can't understand why we don't take the virus more serious.
So, what do you do!
Have a picnic with your selected few to go to the Packer game.
THAT'S REAL LEADERSHIP.
The decision to have any people in the stadium for our game against the Bears was not one that we made lightly, David.
It was based primarily on input from local health officials, including Chris Woleske, President and CEO of Bellin Health; Dr. Michael Landrum, Bellin's Infectious Disease Specialist; and Anna Destree, Brown County's Public Health Officer.
They were comfortable with the protocols that we have put in place, believed that it would be safe for attendees and felt that it would send a strong message to the community that you can co-exist with the pandemic if you wear masks, stay physically distant and wash your hands regularly.
We ended up having 285 people (mostly employees and family members) attend the game, seated (by household) in physically distanced pods of 2, 4 and 6.
We will have the same group invited to attend the Eagles game tomorrow, but think we will have more people (over 500) attend the game because it is an afternoon game.
Most importantly, having these games with employees allows us to evaluate the protocols and will give us the confidence to host games with fans safely if we are allowed to do so by the local health officials.
George from Green Bay
Hey Mark, first, I would like to thank you for watching out for the Packer fans and the whole staff in Lambeau dealing with the whole COVID.
Trust me I am one fan that didn't like not going to the games, but I understand it isn't easy deciding something that everyone is against.
I was wondering is there a realistic timeline to allow fans to attend games this year?
I feel like our Packers need us in the stands to cheer them on in these hard times.
I heard local sports were able to hold games without any COVID issues, like the Green Bay Gamblers.
Also, will you make it mandatory for all players and staff to take the COVID vaccine when it becomes available?
I hope you and your family have a safe and healthy holiday.
Keep up the good work.
Thanks, George.
As I mentioned in the answer above, we would love to have fans at Lambeau Field this year, but would only host fans if the local health officials are confident that we can do so safely.
The key obviously will be the status of the virus in the local community and across the state.
With regard to the vaccine, I do not think we would be able to require players to take it (it would have to be negotiated with the NFLPA and we currently do not require players to take the flu vaccine), but we would certainly strongly encourage it.
Obviously, it would be great if the vaccine were available in time to help us this season, but realistically I don't think it will be available to our teams that soon.
Also, the vaccine can cause people to feel sick for four to five days, so I think players would be reluctant to take it prior to a game.
John from Neenah, WI
I was glad to see that you had employees and their families attend the Bears game.
Why weren't players' families allowed to attend?
Aren't the players also employees?
Good point, John.
Actually, we considered extending the invitation to include players' families.
The difference (and concern), though, is that most of the players' family members live outside of the area.
This is especially true with our younger players.
Our concern is that the family members would be flying into Green Bay from across the country and could present a risk to our players.
If we do eventually have ticketed fans for games this year, we would provide tickets to players for their family members.
In order to reduce the risk of our players contracting the virus, we would consider asking the family members to quarantine and be tested before spending time with their sons.
Bill from Syracuse, NY
I was surprised to see that our game against the Lions on Dec. 13 was moved to 3:25 p.m. Why would FOX want this game broadcast to a larger audience?
I was a little surprised, Bill, but not really that much.
We normally have very strong ratings (as we have a national following), and this is especially true when we are having a winning season.
You can tell how popular an NFL team is by the number of prime-time games it has on the schedule.
Most coaches love the noon games because you get up and play, but if you are playing mostly noon games, you are not a very good team.
With the Carolina game being set for Saturday night, Dec. 19, we will have six prime-time games this year.
We will also play at least four games as the second game of the doubleheader (which is available in most of the country), and could have five depending on whether the Bears game in Week 17 is moved.
Based on these numbers, the networks and the league obviously view the Packers as a team that delivers strong ratings.
Elliot from Minnesota
Dear Mr. Murphy, first off, I want to commend you for being willing to take on the difficult questions, and answering them thoughtfully, that are posed in this forum instead of backing away from them.
I was wondering as someone who not only has to figure out solutions to the current issues, what are some of the long-term challenges that you may see in the sport and how do you go about solving them?
Thanks for your time.
Thanks, Elliot, for a great question.
Given how challenging it is to try to play football during a pandemic, it is hard not to focus solely on the current issues.
I think the best organizations, though, always have an eye on the future.
In my mind, strategic planning for the future is crucial to the success of any organization.
In our planning process, we focus on the next three to five years.
I think a major, long-term issue facing the NFL (and all sports) is whether people will come back to stadiums after the pandemic.
In order to address these concerns, we will have to make the stadiums as safe as possible.
Also, we need to ensure that the fans are having a great experience in the stadium – and that we are providing many of the same amenities that people are used to when they are watching the game on TV at home.
The excellent quality of the at-home TV experience has been an issue for the league for several years, but I think the pandemic has exacerbated it.
Obviously, another major, long-term issue facing the game is the safety of the players.
All injuries are a concern, but especially concussions, due to the potential long-term issues related to concussions.
The league has addressed this by passing over 50 safety-related rules in recent years.
We have also worked closely with our players to show them the techniques they can use to play the game safely.
If parents don't believe the game is safe, they will not allow their sons and daughters to play the game.
This will impact the league not only by reducing the pipeline for potential players, but studies show that people that have played football are more likely to become avid fans.

GREEN BAY – In a matchup pitting the NFL's top defense against the league's most potent offense, the Packers dialed up a game plan befitting a January playoff game at Lambeau Field.
They met the Los Angeles Rams in the trenches, with the trio of Aaron Jones﻿, Jamaal Williams and AJ Dillon combining for 32 rushing attempts during Green Bay's 32-18 victory.
The Packers chipped away at the Rams' defensive front on four first-half scoring drives before Jones finally busted a 60-yard run on the first play of the third quarter.
The six-play drive, on which all 75 yards were gained on the ground, produced a touchdown.
Their 191 combined rushing yards helped open things up for Aaron Rodgers and the rest of the offense during a pulverizing 484-yard performance against the Rams, who allowed just 281.9 yards per game during the regular season.
"I think that set the tone, letting 'em know that we were going to come out physical and what kind of football game it was going to be," Jones said.
"And our coaches told us, 'Stick with it.
Stick with it.
One's going to pop.'
And right after halftime it popped."
With Williams and Dillon both healthy, the Packers threw all three of their running backs at the Rams in the early going.
On several occasions, Green Bay lined up Jones and Dillon in the backfield together with Rodgers in shotgun.
The Packers didn't have a carry of more than nine yards on any individual rush but Williams (seven for 34 yards), Jones (seven for 22) and Dillon (three for 17) continued to plow ahead against a front featuring injured All-Pro defensive tackle Aaron Donald, who played only 39 of LA's 72 snaps due to a rib injury.
The ground production not only enabled the Packers to get into their play-action game, but it also allowed an offensive line playing without star left tackle ﻿David Bakhtiari﻿ to settle in.
And then, after taking a 19-10 lead into halftime, Green Bay finally got the home-run play it was looking for when the Rams adjusted to a five-man base front with just one middle linebacker lurking behind.
With center ﻿Corey Linsley﻿ blocking safety John Johnson at the second level, Jones turned upfield for the 60-yard gain, the third longest run in postseason history for the Packers.
"It was a great run, obviously, by Aaron.
Even so far down the field, he was still able to break a couple tackles," Linsley said.
"Their defense does a great job of throwing looks at you to make you think a lot more.
You're never just settled in there.
"You can't just turn your mind off.
You really have to pay attention to everything that's going on.
That was a different look that they threw at us and I was able to adjust on the fly and help spring that run."
Dillon pounded forward for eight yards on the next play, followed by a 4-yard run by Williams, and then back-to-back Jones runs until he found the end zone to extend Green Bay's lead to 25-10.
The Packers' passing game used that run equity to its advantage, particularly when Rodgers hit receiver ﻿Allen Lazard﻿ on a 58-yard touchdown off play-action in the fourth quarter to extend Green Bay's lead after the Rams cut the game to within seven.
Dillon left late in the game with a quad injury but Williams helped seal the win down the stretch with several strong north-and-south runs, including the final 4-yard pickup before the two-minute warning that sealed the win.
Jones led Green Bay with 99 rushing yards on 14 carries, while Williams added 65 on 12.
Lambeau Field hosted an NFC Divisional playoff matchup between the Green Bay Packers and Los Angeles Rams on Saturday, Jan. 16, 2021.
"I like to have that mentality every week that no one can stop me," Jones said.
"But they were the No.
1 defense coming in and I just think our guys did a great job up front and once the game started it was like, 'Oh yeah.
We're going to be able to run.'
… You've got to be positive, got to manifest things."
Saturday's game not only pitted the league's top defense and highest-scoring offense against each other, but also the top two teams in terms of time of possession this past season.
The Packers dominated in that area, besting LA 36:12 to 23:48, while doubling up the Rams in rushing yards (188 to 96).
With Green Bay's backfield making LA think, Rodgers had five completions of 20 or more yards to four different receivers.
"It's great to be able to do that because obviously people know who Aaron is and who he has to throw to, so it's a lot of weapons out there," said receiver ﻿Davante Adams﻿, who tied a franchise single-game playoff record with nine catches for 66 yards and a TD.
"For us to be able to run the ball like that, it just keeps these defenses honest and makes the end of the game, situations like that, much easier."

A regular season unlike any other received a fitting ending on Sunday as ﻿Aaron Rodgers﻿ put the finishing touches on what could very well be his third NFL MVP campaign.
The Packers' quarterback completed 19-of-24 passes for 240 yards, four touchdowns and no interceptions during Sunday's 35-16 win over Chicago at Soldier Field, clinching Green Bay the top seed in the NFC playoffs for the first time in nine years.
It was 14th time this season Rodgers fashioned a passer rating of at least 100, pushing his season passer rating to 121.5 – second only in NFL history to his record-breaking 122.5 back in 2011.
Individually, Rodgers established new franchise records in completion percentage (70.7%) and touchdown passes (48), both of which led the NFL this season.
Not too shabby for a 37-year-old quarterback some critics felt was no longer the gold standard for the position, playing on a team with a perceived dearth of offensive weapons.
For that reason alone, four-time Pro Bowl receiver ﻿Davante Adams﻿ felt there's no question who the 2020 MVP should be – it's the future Hall of Famer who reminded the NFL what he's all about this season.
"The MVP should be locked up," said Adams after Sunday's win.
"There's nothing else to really talk about.
You look at what we've done and what he's been able to do, and they've hit him with everything.
"(They) said he didn't have any weapons, and we go out there and go 13-3 regular season, which isn't our main goal, obviously, but it's a hell of an accomplishment, especially when you're in your second year with a new staff."
The stakes were high for the Packers, who lost four-time All-Pro left tackle ﻿David Bakhtiari﻿ to a season-ending knee injury in practice on Thursday.
Looking to set the tempo early, Rodgers completed his first 10 passes for 155 yards, including a trio of second-quarter touchdowns to tight end ﻿Robert Tonyan﻿ (15 yards), receiver ﻿Marquez Valdes-Scantling﻿ (72 yards) and tight end ﻿Dominique Dafney﻿ (13 yards).
He made history with each one.
On his first TD pass, which made Rodgers the first QB in NFL history to have two seasons with at least 45 TD passes, Tonyan also tied Paul Coffman's 37-year-old record for most TD catches in a season (11) by a Packers tight end.
Valdes-Scantling's 72-yard bomb later in the second quarter came out of an empty formation in which the Packers got the third-year receiver matched up against linebacker Danny Trevathan.
Head Coach Matt LaFleur said he nearly called timeout on the play as the play clock ticked down but instead trusted Rodgers to get everything under control.
Rodgers did…and it marked the first time the Packers have had a receiver catch two touchdowns of more than 70 yards in the same season since Jordy Nelson did it in 2014.
"That's what so special about a guy like Aaron Rodgers," LaFleur said.
"He saw the matchup, he saw the confusion going on.
… There was definitely a blitz called and he hung in there and two guys made a play.
But I think those are the things that not everybody understands about a guy like Aaron.
Just what he's capable of doing.
How cool he is under pressure."
Meanwhile, Dafney's TD – the first of his young career – marked the 11th different receiver Rodgers has thrown a touchdown to this season, which also established a new franchise record.
Soldier Field hosted a Week 17 matchup between the Green Bay Packers and Chicago Bears on Sunday, Jan. 3, 2021.
Yet, Rodgers was at his best when adversity struck.
His completion streak ended early in the third quarter when Valdes-Scantling dropped a pass that likely would've been a 53-yard touchdown.
Two plays later, the Packers would have to punt for the first time.
The offense would then go three-and-out on its other third-quarter series, allowing Chicago to claw within five, 21-16, entering the fourth quarter.
When the chips were down, Rodgers rallied the offense on a 12-play, 76-yard scoring drive that ate 7 minutes, 35 seconds off the clock in the fourth quarter.
He completed 7-of-8 passes for 64 yards, including a 9-yard pass to Adams on third-and-7 to keep the drive going.
He put the exclamation point on the victory after ﻿Adrian Amos﻿' interception, connecting with Adams on the receiver's 18th TD catch of the season – tying Sterling Sharpe's franchise record.
Fittingly, after stressing production in the "gold" zone this season, Green Bay was a perfect 4-of-4 on Sunday to finish with a league-best TD conversion rate in what's often referred to as the red zone at 78.57%.
"This is a special season.
This will always be a special season for me," Rodgers said.
"I know I've talked probably too much about my mental state and what I've been working on.
It's such a difficult time for so many people.
"I've really just tried to have a good perspective, an attitude of gratitude, and just to really enjoy every moment of this season.
And that's why although it might not have been the most fun, just because I miss the fans, it was maybe the most special regular season."
Rodgers has been exceedingly reflective this season, his 13th as the Packers' starting quarterback.
At several turns, he's made it a point to step back and verbalize his appreciation for all the small moments baked into the team's 13-3 campaign.
After the game, Rodgers gave thanks for Adams, his teammates, the strength and conditioning staff and LaFleur for his "faith and trust in me this season."
However, it was Adams – minutes after completing the most prolific season by a receiver in team history – that stumped one final time for Rodgers being recognized as the Most Valuable Player to wear an NFL uniform in 2020.
Because he's earned it.
"I could talk all day about his MVP push and all of that, but I think he's allowed his play to step up and do that," Adams said.
"And honestly there's been a few other plays that would have cemented it even more, had we made a couple more plays for him where he made a great ball and we came up short.
"It's pretty clear to me who the MVP of the season is.
And it's going to be a person who's won a couple of them before."

The Green Bay Packers this week are mailing invoices to Brown County residents who have been selected to purchase tickets to a 2021 Packers game.
All invoices will reflect regular-season pricing for seats, with each ticket priced at $118.
Invoices are due by April 16, 2021.
Residents who pay for tickets will receive notification in June of the game tickets they will receive.
The tickets are only available as Mobile Tickets, which must be accessed on the ticket holders' smartphones.
The ticket's information is scanned at the gate for entry, allowing phones to serve as a replacement for paper tickets.
Instructions for how to use Mobile Tickets will be provided to residents selected to purchase tickets.
To help enhance the Packers' home field advantage and ensure that Packers fans are sitting in the designated seats each game, the tickets are not available for resale on secondary ticket marketplaces, although they may be transferred digitally to other fans.
Should the COVID-19 pandemic prevent Lambeau Field from hosting fans at full capacity, the Packers will initiate refunds similar to the process in 2020, and Brown County residents chosen in the ticket drawing who paid for the tickets will receive a refund.
If fans are hosted at full capacity, refunds will not be issued.
If the residents chosen in the first drawing do not purchase all available tickets, a second drawing may be held, and a second round of invoices will be sent to the additional selected residents.
As was the case during recent seasons, if a 2019-selected resident who received tickets for a preseason game was selected again to be able to purchase tickets in 2021, he or she will be guaranteed tickets to a regular-season contest.
Those selected for a preseason game will receive a refund of the $50 difference between the regular-season price and the preseason price.
To expedite the refund, fans are encouraged to pay the invoice with a credit card.
Residents may pay for their tickets online using the Packers' Ticketmaster system via packers.com.
Instructions for the online payment method were sent to residents with the ticket invoices.
Invoices also can be paid by credit card or check at the Packers' ticket office at Lambeau Field from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday.
Cash will not be accepted.
Through the Brown County Ticket Drawing program, 2,500 tickets for each home game are made available for Brown County residents to purchase every season.
The program, which has been in place since 2003, allows eligible residents of Brown County to sign up for the opportunity to purchase up to four face value tickets to a single Packers game each season.
Registrations for the program are accepted year-round, and new residents or those who have not signed up for the program in the past are encouraged to sign up through the online system.
To sign up, fans can visit packers.com/browncounty and submit their name, address, phone number and email.
Their name and address within Brown County will be verified by the Packers ticket office prior to the drawing each March.
Residents may also sign up for the program by visiting the Packers ticket office, Lambeau Field Atrium guest services desk or Packers Pro Shop and presenting a photo ID, as well as a second item to verify residency such as a utility bill or bank statement.
Current season ticket holders and their spouses are not eligible.
The drawing is held each March, and randomly selects residents' names for one home game (either preseason or regular-season).
Once residents sign up for the program, they do not need to re-submit their name each year; those on the list will remain on the list until their address changes or they request removal from the list.
For more information about the program and the drawing, please visit packers.com/tickets/brown-county.

An answer during Final Jeopardy from Aaron Rodgers’ stint as the guest host of the game show may provide a viral moment for fans of the NFL and Green Bay Packers.
Rodgers, who hosted 10 episodes, teased the upcoming “Jeopardy!” moment during an interview with Rob Demovsky of ESPN.
According to Rodgers, one contestant didn’t have an answer for the final clue, so he used the opportunity to take a jab at Rodgers and the Packers.
“For about 25 seconds, I’m watching him write this, and he thinks about the answer and says ‘F— it,’ basically, ‘I’m going to write this answer,’ which, probably one of the viral moments of my two weeks will be his response, which is taking a shot at something that happened to us late in the season,” Rodgers said.
During Final Jeopardy, contestants wager money before the clue.
They are then read the clue by the host and given 30 seconds to write out their answers.
Rodgers, who could see the answers in real-time, said it was “pretty amazing” to watch the contestant write out the answer.
It’s possible the shot could have something to do with the long touchdown the Packers gave up late to Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the first half of the NFC title game.
The play was an embarrassing moment for the Packers and a pivotal play in the loss.
Matt LaFleur deciding to kick a field goal late in the fourth quarter is another candidate.
The Packers won 13 games and Rodgers was the NFL’s MVP, but the team lost by five points in the NFC title game to the eventual Super Bowl champions.
Rodgers’ episodes begin airing on Monday, April 5 and last two weeks.

Free agent offensive lineman Lane Taylor visited his second team since the start of the new league year.
According to the league's transaction wire, Taylor – a starter for the Green Bay Packers to open the 2020 season – visited the Houston Texans on Monday.
Taylor visited the San Francisco 49ers last month.
Both teams likely want to check in on his recovery from the ACL injury he suffered in Week 1 of last year.
Taylor took a pay cut and returned to the Packers in 2020, and a strong summer earned him the starting job at right guard.
He was lost...
Daniel Jeremiah's latest mock draft for NFL.com has the Green Bay Packers getting help for the interior of the offensive line in the first round.
Jeremiah sent Alabama offensive lineman Landon Dickerson to the Packers at No.
29 overall.
From Jeremiah: "Dickerson is the best pure interior offensive linemen available.
I thought he might fall out of the first round after his ACL injury, but it appears his recovery is going smoothly.
He can step in following the departure of Corey Linsley."
Dickerson is Jeremiah's No.

The first episode of Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers hosting "Jeopardy!"
aired Monday.
The three-time MVP has nine more episodes airing over the next two weeks.
How did Rodgers do during his opening appearance?
It's time to go to the tape to evaluate the performance.
Here's a light-hearted breakdown of Rodgers' first episode as guest host (note: spoilers ahead):
– Solid intro.
Looks confident, ready for the moment.
Possibly too much swaying back and forth.
He might be fighting some nerves, and that's just fine.
– Terrific job reading the opening categories.
Noted the quotations, emphasized key or interesting words.

Hey everybody.
Thanks for logging on.
I see there already are questions coming in so we'll get started.
In the Inbox today you mention that Davante Adams is under contract until 2021 and with the 5th year option would become a top free agent for the Packers to sign in 2022.
Isn't he now in his second contract?
The reference to the fifth-year option was Jaire Alexander﻿, who would be under contract through 2022 if the Packers exercise the option.
Adams' current contract expires after 2021.
The Badger's game cancellation because of the Covid is disappointing.
Hopefully the Packers can make it through the season without a similar development.
Any idea how many Packer players had the virus this summer and are now somewhat immune?
There were a few players put on the Covid reserve list at the start of training camp, but the Packers have had no players test positive since (fingers crossed).
The situation in our state is really bad and it's unfortunate what's happened with the Badgers, but hopefully no one gets really sick and recovers quickly.
Kamal Martin played his first NFL game but I saw him called the Defense plays, that says a lot about him.
Hope he stays healthy and play great for the Packers.
His debut was a strong one, no doubt.
He definitely earned more snaps.
If both he and Krys Barnes are available, it'll be interesting to see which one wears the green dot.
Hi Mike.
What differences do you see in the Vikings between the Week 1 matchup and now?
Justin Jefferson has come on as a big-play threat as a rookie WR.
He wasn't much of a factor in Week 1, which was his first NFL game, but he's a major factor now.
The Vikings traded Ngakoue, though, and he was their best pass rusher on a D-line that hasn't had, and won't have, Hunter this year.
The Vikings aren't out of it yet but with that trade of the DE last week it feels like they might be throwing in the towel for this year and starting to set themselves for 2021.
Your thoughts?
It was a curious move, but with the expected drop in the salary cap for 2021, it's not a shock to see some higher-priced players moving around.
Some teams are pre-emptively dealing with the potential offseason cap issues.
Money not spent can be carried over.
Just saw the report that a Texans player has tested positive for COVID.
Do you expect the Packers to do anything differently on the chance that player (whoever he is) could have infected any Packers?
The Packers are testing every day, just like every other team.
I'm not sure what there would be to do differently.
Mike, what is the biggest threat Minnesota is bringing to Lambeau on Sunday?
They have offensive weapons.
I already mentioned Jefferson.
Thielen, Cook, Rudolph are all proven producers.
Cousins has had a rough year thus far, but if he used the bye week to reset, he's always capable of a big game.
So, to me, the offense and perhaps a nothing-to-lose attitude at 1-5 are the biggest threats they bring.
What is Aaron Jones﻿' availability looking like this weekend?
Couldn't tell you.
We'll see how the week goes.
Calf injuries can be tricky, and the Packers have another game next Thursday.
From what my eyes tell me the Packers offense has been more productive when they use pre snap motion.
As a veteran flag football player, I can tell you it's a lot harder to play against the motion stuff because your responsibilities can change in a split second, and if you're unsure your first step is going to be back.
The one L this year they didn't use motion as much.
You think that's in the coaches minds?
I'm sure they're aware of it.
They self-scout everything they call.
LaFleur said the decision to use less motion against Tampa Bay was opponent-based, according to their film study.
Hi Mike.
The last time we meet Dalvin Cook he rushed for 50 yards but scored twice.
Perhaps the Vikings try to establish the run, so what can you tell about the necessary adjustments the defense needs to do in order to contain him?
Cook can be tough to tackle.
He gets a lot of yards after contact because he's really powerful.
The more defenders the Packers can get to the ball the better.
Fewer tackles are missed when it's a gang effort.
See the Seahawks just traded for Dunlap.
any chance Packers make any real move in the next week?
I honestly have no idea.
These are such strange times, as I mentioned, with the pending cap situation next year and all.
If/when Christian Kirksey comes back, do you see a rotation at MLB or has he earned that 3 down role?
That could depend on how the next couple of weeks go.
There's no decision to be made yet, and Barnes exited the last game with an injury.
If everyone's healthy and the Packers have options, the coaches will consider it a great problem.
(Update: LaFleur told the media later that Kirksey is expected to return to practice this week.)
What do you think Detroit's defense may be like with the addition of Griffen?
The Lions have been in need of more pass rush, and Griffen can add that.
They haven't gotten the production they paid for out of Trey Flowers, but with a bookend partner, maybe they get better at both edge spots now.
﻿Aaron Rodgers﻿ has put a lot of NFC north coaches on the hot seat.
Do you think management takes that into consideration when evaluating a coaching staff, that the division has someone like him they are competing against in the standings and x2 yearly?
The NFL is about being better than the other guys.
If you aren't better at QB you have to be better in other areas to beat them.
Evaluations like that aren't based solely on how a team competes within its own division.
Do you expect some opportunities for ﻿Marquez Valdes-Scantling﻿ this week?
If the Vikings focus on Adams like we expect, somebody else should be open.
The Packers will have to figure out their best options.
The Vikings will have a better plan for Adams than the first game, and a better one than Houston had last week.
Adams will still get his chances, but MVS, ﻿Robert Tonyan﻿, ﻿Jace Sternberger﻿, ﻿Darrius Shepherd﻿, ﻿Malik Taylor﻿, etc., will have to make a play when it comes their way.
Why is the first Packers/Bears game so late in the season this year?
I thought the NFL had moved toward first division games being earlier.
One of those quirks with how the schedule fell.
The Packers are playing the Vikings for a second time four weeks before they play the Bears for the first time.
The league packed a lot of division games into Weeks 1-2 -- the Packers had two -- but then didn't have any in Weeks 3-4.
It worked!
I wore my Kelly Green INDUBITABLY shirt the first quarter, took it off for the rest of the game and proudly put it back on at the end!
The defense tackled very well as there were a lot fewer broken tackles!!
Thanks!
There you go.
Who's your guy on offense this week?
Same question for defense?
I mentioned in Inbox I look for ﻿Rashan Gary﻿ and ﻿Kenny Clark﻿ as key guys on defense this week.
Offense?
I need to see the injury list, but the other WRs aside from Adams will need to contribute because Kendricks is as good a cover LB on TEs as there is in the league.
Based on YTD production, who's your MVP?
It's definitely Rodgers.
If not him I'd say Aaron Jones, even though he missed one game, but if Davante Adams doesn't miss any more time, we could be in the midst of a really amazing season.
Had the pleasure of being at the game in Houston this past Sunday.
Saw lots of fans in Packer attire.
In my section, appeared to be 60% Packers fans.
Could you tell from the TV coverage that the Packer faithful were in lots of the seats?
I didn't really see many crowd shots on the TV broadcast, but LaFleur and the players definitely noticed the cheering and GPG chants from those who attended.
You know what I don't miss?
Reviewed pass interference calls.
It was a good idea that was poorly executed, and if the rule isn't going to be applied with any consistency, it's better that it's gone.
What's with the League scheduling Thursday night games with such travel.
There should be plenty of matchups without having to make a team travel two time zones.
Your thoughts...
I've always thought Thursday games with long flights were really unfair.
It's not necessary.
Have you ever seen Aaron Rodgers salty at a presser like he was last week?
It happens.
He thought the questions were bad.
He's not normally like that.
One of those things.
I don't think it needs to be a big deal either way.
What can you tell us about the two new guys, ﻿James Burgess﻿ and Roberts?
Wes posted a 5 things to know item Monday on Burgess if you want to check it out.
They both have plenty of NFL experience.
These aren't newbies to the league.
Experienced depth is never a bad thing in my mind.
Why was our practice squad player, ﻿Dexter Williams﻿, in on the blocked punt last week?
Injury to someone else?
He was on the active roster due to Aaron Jones being out, and he took the special-teams spot of ﻿Jamaal Williams﻿ because Williams was playing a lot more snaps on offense than normal.
Williams was back in there after the block.
It seems like the Packers either win BIG, or lose HARD!
No in between from what we've seen so far.
Do you feel the Packers can play Tampa and win BIG in the playoffs?
I just see the 49ers game all over again.
Long way to go before it's worth talking about.
Your mention of Flowers got me thinking about how former Patriots players and coaches tend to fare after leaving NE.
It tends to be not well.
Gostkowski missing the game-tying FG etc.
I even thought TB might be susceptible to the curse when he forgot it was 4th down, but he seems to have righted the ship.
The Buccaneers have made a pretty big statement the last two weeks.
The Packers and Raiders are no slouch teams and they handled them both, convincingly.
That Tampa Bay loss at Chicago seems to have set them off.
They had no business losing that game and they knew it.
Did you catch the quadruple doink in the Rice game last week?
Football is a weird game sometimes.
Yeah, I saw the highlight.
That was nuts.
You couldn't make a ball do that if you tried from 10 yards away.
Wisconsin-Nebraska football game canceled after 12 positive coronavirus tests.
Yeah, that's unfortunate.
The positive tests apparently include the head coach.
I just hope everyone's going to be OK.
Will the Packers make a trade for a receiver?
Everyone's asking about trades.
I really don't know.
The incoming player's contract can have a lot to do with it given the implications.
It looked like "Matt" Pettine dialed up more blitzes against Houston.
Do you see him staying aggressive with the blitz?
I think that's a week-to-week thing with the defense.
I don't think he dialed up any more blitzes against Houston than other weeks, but they were more effective.
The 7-man pressure in the red zone is a call he rarely makes, and it worked to perfection.
There's no guarantee with those all-out calls, though.
The more the players can get the results, the more inclined he'll be to dial it up.
Do you feel there will be a playoff bubble with the pandemic not slowing in any way?
There were reports the league was looking into the possibility of a playoff bubble in January, possibly after the first round of games.
I haven't heard anything since, but that approach would not surprise me.
It worked great for baseball.
No positive tests until Justin Turner last night, finding out in the middle of the game no less.
But that was baseball's first positive test in 8 weeks, I believe.
Any Allen Lazard sightings since the surgery?
He was at practice doing rehab stuff one day last week that Wes observed.
He's eligible to practice starting this week if he's cleared, but I have no knowledge of his timeline.
(Update: LaFleur told the media later Lazard will be returning to practice this week.)
During the broadcast of TB game, a commentator noted Josh Jackson "was in the doghouse."
Just typical jargon, or from your perspective, was JJ in coach's doghouse?
if so, any idea what reason?
I don't know how a guy could be in a doghouse and then get called on to start the game.
Jackson had a rough second half at Tampa on a couple of plays, but I thought he played well the first half that game, and he did well in Houston.
I don't think he's in any doghouse.
With the short turnaround after this week's game, will we still get the usual coverage from you and Wes (WYMM, mid-week chat, etc.
)?
We'll have to see what the beginning of next week looks like.
Everything is going to be crammed in so we'll do our best.
Since you're having to watch the TV broadcast of games, have you been paying any attention to the commentating?
If so, has it changed your perspective on situations in any way?
As I mentioned in Inbox, I have the sound on for the road games, but I'm really not listening unless they're discussing a controversial play or replay review.
The rest I tune out.
For the home games I'm in the press box, where the TVs are muted.
If they do institute a playoff bubble, I think they should do one for NFC and one for AFC.. hosted by the city which earned the 1 seed (should they advance).
Although, that could make field conditions tricky with multiple games on the same field.
I think they'd have to do it at venues with artificial surfaces so you could play multiple games in one weekend.
A natural grass field would not hold up in that scenario.
Do you think Cousins will ignore the side of the field Jaire is on like Watson did, or do you see him throwing the ball to Theilen early and often like normal?
Alexander picked him off in Week 1 when his throw was off-target.
I don't think Cousins will be able to afford to ignore one of his top targets just because Alexander is on him, whoever that is.
But he's thrown a lot of picks this season and teams have made him pay for poor accuracy.
Any comments on Justin Turner testing positive and the Dodgers WS celebration?
It's unfortunate, and really strange that the test results came back in the middle of the game.
I completely understand Turner's desire to celebrate with his teammates.
I really do.
But he shouldn't have.
His own manager is a cancer survivor, is he not?
Windy on Sunday.
Does that favor either team?
It favors the QB with the stronger arm.
I think we know who that is.
Any update on ﻿David Bakhtiari﻿?
Haven't heard anything, but the fact that the Packers didn't put him on IR would indicate it's not expected to be a long-term absence.
The "other" Adams (﻿Montravius Adams﻿) seems to be playing very well recently.
Sometimes it seems some players just need a little more time to develop, agree?
Montravius has always shown flashes.
He's shown a few more this year, but it's all about consistency for him.
He needs to keep his level of play steady.
The more he does that, the more he'll play and the more the defense will benefit.
He's off to a good start this year with the role he's been given.
Who needs a win more, MCcarthy or Zimmer?
I think it's safe to say both have a similarly big need.
But I don't think either coach is in jeopardy of losing his job, if that's what you're asking.
Any word on Cook's status?
He was injured before their bye, and it seems that as he goes, so go the Vikes.
Nothing definitive, but some reports are he's expected back.
I assume the Packers are going to prepare for him to play unless they hear otherwise.
Any thoughts on holding Bakhtiari and Jones for the 49er game?
That's a tough call.
You don't want to take any game for granted, but two games in five days, no matter who the opponents are, is tough for anyone coming back from an injury.
That's why the medical staff makes the decision.
They know better than anyone the risks.
Who's a bigger threat in the division, Lions or Bears?
I say Lions.
Right now I'd still say Bears because their defense is really good.
But Chicago plays New Orleans and Tennessee the next two games.
If they drop both and are 5-4, and if the Lions move up the dynamics in the division will change.
Detroit has Indy this week, then several games against sub-.500 clubs.
Stay tuned I guess.
Rams released their rookie kicker yesterday, Gostowski missed a tying FG Sunday.....how we take ﻿Mason Crosby﻿ for granted!
I don't think anybody does, really.
Did you see the Carolina kicker come a whisker away from making that 65-yarder last Sunday?
That was some kick.
Dead center, too.
Just under the crossbar.
The bigger threat is who is in front of you right now.
Those of us on the west side of WI always see the ViQueens as a threat regardless of records.
And that's all that matters this week for the Packers.
We'll call that the last word for today.
Thanks for all the participation, as always, folks.
Take care and stay safe.
Not sure about a chat next week but I'll do my best to fit it in somehow, if I can.
Best, Mike

Packers team historian
Paul from Bemidji, MN
I'm guessing no photos exist from when the Packers played their first game more than 100 years ago, but any tidbits about what the atmosphere would have been like?
It was played in Hagemeister Park, just north of Walnut Street and east of Baird Street, where Green Bay East High School stands today.
In 1919, there was no ballpark, so the Packers played their eight home games on a sandlot field.
There was no fence, no seating and no tickets were sold, although George Whitney Calhoun, the Packers' co-founder, passed a hat asking fans to throw in their spare change to support the team.
I believe you're correct; or at least I've never seen a photo from a Packers game that season; only two team pictures taken in front of the Indian Packing Company garage at the end of it.
The first game was played Sept. 15, 1919, and the Green Bay Press-Gazette said it drew a record crowd, presumably for a local amateur or semipro game.
Later estimates of the crowd size ranged up to 1,500, whereas high school games had drawn up to several thousand more fans before that.
Kickoff was 3 p.m., and quarters were 12 minutes long.
Obviously, there were no lights at the park.
Or TV timeouts.
The Packers wore new blue jerseys with white socks, and used 18 or 20 players, depending on whether the box score or the game story was accurate.
Most of them had recently played for either East or Green Bay West High School.
Four of the players were still teenagers; the oldest, Jim Coffeen, was 31.
It wasn't much of a game.
The Press-Gazette reported the Packers beat the Menominee (Mich.) North End A.C., 53-0, but the team wasn't nearly as formidable as the name made it sound.
The newspapers in Menominee and its twin-city, Marinette, Wis., claimed it was a neighborhood team from Marinette that actually had played the Packers.
One paper said the name of it was Leannah's Colts; the other said it was Marinette's Second Ward team.
Some fans would pull their Model-Ts up close to the sideline and watch from the comfort of their cars.
Calhoun, who was the Press-Gazette's city editor in 1919, said years later that other fans would arrive with their horses and buggies.
No doubt, most came by streetcar or walked.
During the game, fans were allowed to stroll up and down the sidelines, following the ball.
Some might even have wandered onto the field.
Carl Zoll, who went the distance at right guard in that first game, said years later, it wasn't unusual for "some drunk (to) come on the field and make some trouble."
Actually, I think the best description I've heard was given to me by Ken Kaye in a 2003 interview.
Ken, who was the father of former Packers scout Jesse Kaye, grew up not far from Hagemeister Park and started going to Packers games in 1919.
Here's how he described the scene from that time: "When I first went to a Packer game there were no stands.
They used to have a rope to keep people off the field.
But there used to be a lot of belligerent and enthusiastic fans and they'd end up tackling the (gosh darn) opposition.
This was very crude football.
In those days, organizational football was very crude and I'm not kidding you.
This is not a fantasy."
Earl from Baltimore, MD
I'm told one of the original Packers was a player named Gus Rosenow.
Do you have any biographical information about him and hopefully a photo?
I'm a family genealogist and interested in namesakes of distinction.
Gus was one of the marvels of that first Packers team.
He was missing his left arm from his elbow down, yet played halfback and was described by Press-Gazette sportswriter Val Schneider as an outstanding blocker, a good open field runner and a sure-handed – although one-handed – receiver.
"He is able to spear forward passes with the best of pass receivers," Schneider wrote.
Rosenow was 27, one of the older players on the team.
A native of Menasha, Wis., where he played at least a year of high school football, Rosenow was coaching at Green Bay West High School at the time.
He stood 6-feet and weighed 170 pounds, and that was big for the day.
In fact, he was bigger than the Packers' two starting tackles and center in that first game.
While Rosenow had graduated from the University of Wisconsin in 1917, I could find no record of him playing football there.
But I do believe he might have been the only college graduate on the original Packers, although at least two players on that first team played college football after they played for the Packers.
Rosenow also played in 1920 and in the first three non-league games in 1921.
However, he didn't play in any of the six American Professional Football Association games and, therefore, isn't listed on the all-time NFL roster.
If you have any additional information on Gus, please pass it along.
And the same goes for other readers.
I'm interested in learning more about the players on those first two Packers teams.
Phyliss from Brownstown, MI
I was wondering if you have any information on Al Petcka.
I heard he was my grandmother's cousin.
Like Rosenow, Petcka, 25, was one of the older players on the 1919 team.
Although born in Chicago, he had played football at Green Bay East from 1910-12.
He also was a veteran of previous amateur and neighborhood teams in Green Bay.
Petcka started five games at left tackle for the 1919 Packers.
He also played in four games in their second season.
Interestingly, I believe you are at least the third person to contact me with some family connection to Petcka.
Michael from Redding, CA
Trying to find more information on my grandfather, George Medley.
The family has always thought he played two years for the Packers, 1919-20.
Is there any source that might have more information?
George played six games in 1920 and started five at quarterback.
He started the first three, missed two, started two of the next three and then didn't play in the last three, so he may have gotten hurt.
I know there was a reference or two, or maybe even more, in the Press-Gazette years later identifying Medley as one of the original Packers, but that wasn't the case.
Keep in mind, it was almost impossible for writers even as late as the 1950s or early '60s to get their hands on old editions of the Press-Gazette; and then, without an index, it was even more difficult to search for specific information.
Thus, they were usually forced to write history from memory and such mistakes were not uncommon.
In 1919, the Press-Gazette printed lineups, including subs, for all 11 games and George was never listed, nor was he in the team picture.
However, he played with several of the original Packers, including Rosenow, on Green Bay's Northern Paper Mill basketball team in the winter of 1920, only weeks after the 1919 football season ended.
That team advanced to play in the national Amateur Athletic Union basketball tournament in Atlanta.
Your grandfather was a member of the 1917 Marinette High School team that won what was an unofficial state football championship.
And four players from that team – the others were Buff Wagner, Eddie Glick and Sammy Powers – played with the early Packers.
Now, can I ask a question: When I was in grade school, a George "Butch" Medley was an all-state back at Green Bay West and later played at Northern Michigan.
Was he related to your grandfather?
Lisa from Atlanta, GA
My grandfather, Earl Skogg, played for the Packers (Green Bay City Team).
His daughter, my mother, Joan Skogg (now Kaster), worked as a secretary for the Packers.
I'd like to get a digital copy of the picture the Packers have on display.
My grandfather is the second from the left.
I believe you're talking about the 1917 Green Bay All-Stars team picture in the Pre-Packers section of our Hall of Fame.
That picture, taken in the old Hagemeister minor-league ballpark, is owned by the Neville Public Museum, and I believe you can purchase a copy through its website.
As I stated, Calhoun joined the Press-Gazette in the spring of 1917 and immediately started organizing leagues and promoting sporting events.
The Green Bay All-Stars' 27-0 victory over the Marinette Badgers that year was an example.
Calhoun pitched it as the first semi-pro football game in Green Bay history, but it also was that team's first and last game.
Curly Lambeau was the star, scoring two of the All-Stars' four touchdowns, the year before he played for Notre Dame.
While that team had nothing to do with the Packers, I know your grandfather played at East High School; for the 1915 Green Bay Supply Co. team, one of the city's better amateur outfits pre-Packers; and then in that 1917 game.
Going back to his days at East, future Packers Petcka and Wally Ladrow were teammates; and then three other future Packers besides Lambeau played with him on that All-Star team: Nate Abrams, Andy Muldoon and Jim Coffeen.
No doubt, your grandfather was of similar ilk as a player.
I also think he might have been a good hockey player, too.
There were other Skoggs playing on local football and hockey teams, and the Press-Gazette didn't always print first names.
But another of Calhoun's endeavors after he joined the Press-Gazette was organizing a city hockey league and a Skogg was one of the better players in the league.
As background, Calhoun was a sophomore when he formed the first the first hockey team at his high school in Buffalo, and also served as its goalie and captain.
Timothy from Cupertino, CA
My great uncle, Wally Ladrow, was an early Packers player.
One story is that Uncle Wally broke his leg in the first official NFL game against the Bears.
His pregnant wife, Alma, made him quit football after that.
Is there are any truth to the story?
Here's what I can tell you.
Wally played in the Packers' first three non-league games in 1921, then got hurt and didn't play in the next three, although I don't know the nature of his injury.
His last game was against Evansville on Nov. 6, the Packers' third APFA game.
I don't know if he broke his leg at any point, but the Packers' first league game was against Minneapolis (not the Bears) and the Evansville game was the last for many of the homegrown Packers who got the team off the ground in 1919.
They were replaced by new recruits who had some college football and even APFA experience in an effort to compete in what soon became the NFL.
The Packers beat Evansville, 43-6, and so 21 players got into the game, whereas no more than 14 played in three of the other five APFA games.
A 5-9, 180-pound back, Ladrow played in 10 games with the original Packers and in nine in 1920.
He, too, played at East High in 1912.
Ladrow also was captain of the Indian Packing baseball team and played for Green Bay's city baseball team in 1921.
Bruce from La Crosse, WI
Wally Ladrow is my first cousin twice removed.
I am hoping to encourage the Belgian Heritage Center in Namur, Wis., to add information on his Packers history to its displays.
My first question is: Do you have any information that could be given to the BHC?
Question 2, are you in contact with any of his descendants?
I don't have a lot more information than what I wrote in the previous answer, but I could provide some assistance in the future if need be.
What I would suggest is trying to get the BHC to do a display on all of the other Belgians on the 1919 Packers in addition to what it has on Lambeau.
I'm not sure of the exact number, but I believe there are others besides your cousin and Curly.
Yes, one of Wally's grandsons is a friend of mine.
Karen from Oconto, WI
I was wondering if my dad, Herbert Webster, ever played for the Packers?
He was born in 1894 and went to East High School.
No, he never played for the Packers.
I believe he played at East High in the fall of 1911, actually on the same team as Earl Skogg.
Your dad's 1912 graduating class at East also included Lee Joannes, who was president of the Packers from 1930 to 1947.
But some of the stories are whoppers

Hi Mike.
I've been following NFL and the Pack since "The Majik Man" days and can't wait to finally see the green and gold play in London (fingers and toes all crossed).
But whilst a pint of Boddies is perfectly quaffable, please let me buy you and Wes a proper Ale, say Timmy Taylor's "Landlord" or Sharp's "Atlantic."
Can't wait!
Cheers.
A lot of beer and baseball chatter today.
I may have picked the wrong day to return.

The most important physical attribute to being a good hitter in baseball is eyesight.
The second is confidence in one's ability to hit said baseball and perform well even in a hitting slump.
What would you say is the most important physical attribute to being a successful football player is in your mind?
Toughness.
You can be the smart quarterback, the fastest receiver or the most fundamentally sound linebacker.
But you have to be tough to last 17 games in the NFL.
It's the great equalizer.
If you don't have that, nothing else matters.
Brian from Louisville, KY
I would love the league to add a second bye week to the new schedule.
That way, the Super Bowl would be the Sunday before Presidents Day and most would hopefully have that Monday off.
What do you think, Wes?
I'm still in favor of a single bye.
The season is long enough as it is.
Maybe players feel differently but I think everybody would rather have an extra week in the offseason rather than an additional week that you're tied to the NFL season.
Thomas from Appleton, WI
It kind of just dawned on me that the versatility ﻿Billy Turner﻿, ﻿Lucas Patrick﻿ and ﻿Elgton Jenkins﻿ allows the team on game days also carries over into the draft.
I'm sure the Packers would like to add a talented prospect or two after losing Corey Linsley, but it doesn't really matter which position he plays along the offensive line.
With ﻿David Bakhtiari﻿'s availability in question early, this has to be 1A or 1B in terms of priorities heading into the NFL Draft, right?
I agree.
Simply put, draft the best offensive lineman available and figure the rest out in July.
TK from Grafton, WI
Do most players care what number they wear?
Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't, sometimes it rains.
Think about that for a while.
David from Kenosha, WI
Hey Mike and Wes, with all the talk on position and depth, it seems some players are not talked about and I am curious on your opinion on guys such as ﻿Equanimeous St. Brown﻿, ﻿Jake Hanson﻿, ﻿Vernon Scott﻿ and ﻿Ka'dar Hollman﻿.
All were drafted players for a reason with a good level of talent, but they seem to be forgotten when discussing their position groups.
Hanson is a wild card because we didn't see much of him over the summer and then he got hurt while on the practice squad.
St. Brown and Scott have had their moments, but Scott really intrigues me as a second-year player.
He was a one-year starter whose draft stock took a hit with TCU not having a pro day.
I liked what I saw from Scott, though.
He has the requisite size, speed and wherewithal to play dime safety.

Did you just open yourselves up to a load of questions/discussions about the draft board?
Spoff might have, but I didn't.
My name is Weston.
Nathan from Philadelphia, PA
The Packers probably don't let even team reporters within sight of the room with the draft board, but as far as you know, does the big board have every eligible player on it somewhere?
Or does a team ever consider the red flags about a guy's character or history so significant that they would not draft him in any round?
You know, I've heard of the phrase, "Taking a player off the board," but I never followed up to ask if that's to be taken literally.
Maybe there's a smaller board off to the side?
Nik from Moore, SC
How many immediate "starters" do we need from this draft/FA signings?
I'd say two: one IDL and one OL (OT or C).
This seems very attainable.
Some may not like ﻿Kevin King﻿ or ﻿Marquez Valdes-Scantling﻿, but they are starters in this league on many other teams.
I don't think our "needs" to improve are as great as many in the media think they are.
﻿Dean Lowry﻿ and ﻿Kingsley Keke﻿ may not be stars, but they are starting quality NFL players.
This draft may turn out to be more about depth for '22-23.
I can't wait for those comments.
The Packers don't paint themselves into a corner like that, so I don't know if there's any position where they need to draft a starter.
Now, are there some positions where it would behoove the Packers to have a rookie compete for a starting role right off the bat?
Absolutely.
Both lines, cornerback, linebacker and even receiver top that list for me.
Scott from Sheboygan, WI
Insiders, a wizard comes to you and says "I can guarantee the Packers will play in the next Super Bowl, or I will grant you invisibility for three days so you can be in the Packers' war room during the draft."
Which do you choose?
I stop the wizard at "The Super Bowl" before he can finish his sentence.
Roger from Lakewood Ranch, FL
So, I'm guessing the Packers will play their first international game in London in 2022 or 2023?
They may be giving up a home game, but they should still have eight games in GB.
Looks to me like refusing to give up a home game in the past has worked out for the area's economy just fine!
This was the biggest silver lining for me with the expanded schedule.
The only two things I haven't done as an NFL beat writer is cover a Super Bowl (see previous answer) and an international game.
Hopefully, we check both off the old Hod bucket list in the coming years.
Steven from Edgewater, MD
NFLPA president JC Tretter argued that teams' ability to function the way they did this past season proved that you do not need preseason games or OTAs; things veteran players have typically seen as a lose-only proposition risking injury for no benefit.
He inadvertently may have pointed out that regular team practices are plenty to evaluate and develop players.
Do players get better by playing preseason games or is it just showing what the coaches already figured out from training camps?
I get where JC and veterans are coming from.
I mean, you all know my feelings by now on a 17-game season.
That being said, I still believe there is a huge benefit to conducting a preseason for young players and undrafted free agents to compete.
Without a preseason, there is no opportunity for NFL teams to see these players, and teams aren't going to blindly claim players unless the active roster is expanded beyond 53 players.
Those spots are too valuable.
Personally, I don't believe it's fair to young guys making a couple thousand dollars a week with no guarantees past Sept. 1.
Josh from Oshkosh, WI
With the expansion of the regular season, will any padded practices be added?
I highly doubt that.
Ferdinand from Woodbury, MN
Am I missing something?
Won't the Packers now be guaranteed TWO international games every eight years instead of one (one home and one away)?
Unless the NFL makes some other division play three in an eight-year period...
Potentially.
But it depends on whether teams will still be allowed to protect one home game like the Chargers did in 2019.
If they can, there's no way any NFL team is letting the Packers game be played anywhere but its home stadium.
Bruce from Jackson, WI
Welcome back Wes.
When asked earlier this week if there was a chance with the 17th game being added the NFL might add an additional game to the total number of games a team can participate in primetime, Mike responded, "Selfishly, from a work standpoint, I hope not."
Do you think he was serious?
We're talking about one additional game.
I would think with more basketball and baseball evening games you both would be more night owls than morning folks.
The exposure has to be better for the team.
Spoff was absolutely serious and I concur with him.
I don't get much sleep after night games.
As the Monday "Packers Daily" guy this past season, I needed to be back in at 9 a.m. CT regardless of when I left the building.
Spoff's lot is even worse because he's responsible for penning Inbox for the next morning after already filing two game stories.
If we could play every NFL game at noon, that would be grrrrrrrrrrrreat.
OK?

IIs, the financials for 18 regular-season games would be too easy for the owners to get behind and I'm surprised it didn't happen last CBA.
Eighteen regular-season games, plus an extra bye week, making it two per team.
The regular season would expand over 20 weeks.
That would be three more weeks than last season and two more weeks than the current schedule.
Two additional weeks of regular-season NFL games would be a lot of TV revenue.
Sure, but there's also these 2,000 or so human beings who play in the games that need to be involved in these decisions.
They're called players.
They have a say in the matter, as well.
You can't just tell your millwrights they're losing two weeks of vacation to work more.
You gotta discuss it with the union.
Jordan from Virginia Beach, VA
Happy Easter/Passover Inbox!
Is the 17th game going to be played against a new division each year?
If so, do we know the rotation after the AFC West?
It will be a four-year rotation against the AFC but an official announcement hasn't been made.
It'll be a team from either the AFC North or South coming to Lambeau, though.
Joe from Swansea, IL
For all the angst about the '21 schedule (Chiefs!
Ravens!
Steelers!
Seahawks!
Browns!
49ers!
Saints!
Cardinals!
WFT!
), maybe it will help to think of the fans of all those teams with a little angst of their own (Packers!).
Wanna be the best?
Beat the best.
And it's way, way, way too early to know how those teams will be playing when The Pack encounter them on the schedule.
I've also covered the league long enough to tell you the complexion of an NFL schedule often looks vastly different come December.
Teams rise and fall every year.
Eric from Green Bay, WI
Insiders, who's your pre-draft candidate to go worst-to-first in 2021?
I'm going with the boomerang theory: San Francisco.
Eric from Baker, FL
Philadelphia is proposing "to amend Rule 6, Section 1, Article 1, to permit a team to maintain possession of the ball after a score by substituting one offensive play (4th-and-15 from the kicking team's 25-yard line) for an onside kickoff attempt."
This is an intriguing alternative that I could get behind to at least try out for a year.
Thoughts?
It's an interesting idea, but I still have the same problem with it that I did last year: I don't trust the refs not to blow it.

I am 77, a Packers fan since age 4, and attended the Ice Bowl (my favorite Packers game).
Would love to hear from you and others your ages, years of being fans, and favorite game.
Could this possibly be a future Outsiders Inbox question?
We've asked questions like this in the past but I don't recall asking the favorite game a person has attended.
I'll jot it down.
Dave from Coloma, MI
With Cliff Christl's article on people who claim to play for the Packers, I'm going to tell my grandkids I wrote for the Insider Inbox.
Whoever is in charge then can state, "While he never wrote for the Inbox, he did have his questions published several times."
It's the equivalent to players who might have played an exhibition game but never during the regular season.
Fair.
Cliff has penned so many interesting and important stories about the Green Bay Packers during my lifetime, but Thursday's Q&A was easily my favorite thing Cliff has ever written.
Just Mutumbo-ing everybody.
Mike from Cascade, ID
Hi Wes, welcome back.
With all the focus on QBs in the upcoming draft, how do you think this year's crop compares to the 1983 QB draft class?
That's a lofty comparison.
It would be cool to see five quarterbacks get selected in the first 10 picks but get back to me when three of them are Pro Football Hall of Famers.
The 1983 class had equal parts quantity and quality.
Mark from Pitt Meadows, British Columbia
I got an April Fool's text message ﻿Aaron Rodgers﻿ was traded to the Vikings; he was in purple helmet and all wearing No.
12.
I immediately knew it was just to get a reaction on a day of pranks but I still cringed at it!
It's all fun and games till someone gets hurt.
Go Pack Go!
When I was just a wee lad, Grandpa Hod, God rest his soul, gave me the best advice I've ever received on the topic of April Fool's: Don't.
Derek from Eau Claire, WI
Welcome back Wes!
What's your go-to Easter side dish?

Scott from Lincoln City, OR
Hey Wes, it's back to the grind time.
What was the highlight of your time away?
Pushing my son on our swing in the backyard and driving my wife to work one day while her car was getting fixed.
I'm not one to lay on a beach somewhere and post "YOLO" photos to make my life seem cooler than it is for Facebook.
I'm a simple guy.
I don't need much.
I just wanted to hang out with my son.
Honestly, that's what I missed the most from the pandemic offseason.
But yes, it's good to be back.
HAVE A QUESTION?
It takes a village of scouts to draft a player
No one really knows what's going to happen until it happens
There's plenty of value in chemistry and continuity
It has to be a first, or very rare
There's no telling how it shakes out
It just means the game is the game
There's no reason to prioritize one position
Explosiveness and vision are what make Aaron Jones special
It's not easy making the cut
The D-Train isn't just a slogan.
The camaraderie is real.
Who are the best defensive players drafted over the last 30 years?

GREEN BAY – A horrible sequence of plays at the end of the first half and beginning of the second half doomed the Packers on Sunday as they lost the NFC Championship Game to the Buccaneers, 31-26 at Lambeau Field.
Tampa Bay scored on a long TD pass in the final seconds of the first half and then added another TD when the Packers fumbled on the opening drive of the second half, setting up QB Tom Brady with a short field.
The Buccaneers led at that point 28-10.
Green Bay rallied with the help of three interceptions on defense, but the Packers only scored six points off those turnovers and came up short.
It's the fourth straight loss for the Packers in the NFC title game over a seven-year span.
On the day, QB ﻿Aaron Rodgers﻿ was 33-of-48 for 346 yards with three TDs, one interception and a 101.6 passer rating.
WR ﻿Marquez Valdes-Scantling﻿ caught four passes for 115 yards, including a 50-yard TD.
WR ﻿Davante Adams﻿ added nine catches for 67 yards and a TD.
RBs ﻿Aaron Jones﻿ and ﻿Jamaal Williams﻿ combined for 50 rushing yards on 13 attempts, with ﻿AJ Dillon﻿ adding 17 yards on three runs.
Jones left the game with a chest injury early in the third quarter.
For Tampa Bay, Brady was 20-of-36 for 280 yards with three TDs and the three picks for a 73.8 passer rating.
WR Chris Godwin had five catches for 110 yards.
RBs Leonard Fournette and Ronald Jones combined for 71 yards on 22 carries, with Fournette scoring a TD on a 20-yard run.
Here's a recap of all the action:
The Packers won the opening coin toss and deferred.
Green Bay forced Tampa Bay into three third-down situations but Tom Brady completed three passes for 56 yards, including a 15-yard touchdown pass to Mike Evans to give the Buccaneers a 7-0 lead with 10 minutes, 59 seconds left in the first quarter.
The Packers converted their initial first down with a 14-yard pass to Marcedes Lewis in the middle of the field but would have to punt after Aaron Rodgers was sacked on third down.
With Tampa Bay facing third-and-10, Kenny Clark pushed Aaron Stinnie back to sack Brady for a 5-yard loss.
The Packers faced third-and-15 from their own five but Rodgers ran right to extend the play and found Allen Lazard near the sideline for a leaping 23-yard catch.
Davante Adams then picked up 15 off a quick flare to end the first quarter.
The Packers tied the game at 7-7 with Rodgers hitting ﻿Marquez Valdes-Scantling﻿ on a 50-yard touchdown pass after the third-year receiver beat Carlton Davis down the sideline in single coverage.
Tampa Bay answered back, with Brady converting yet another third down with a 52-yard deep ball to Chris Godwin.
On the next play, Leonard Fournette spun free of a tackle and pushed the ball in for a 20-yard touchdown run.
The Packers countered with Rodgers finding Valdes-Scantling on a slant for 12 yards against a blitz.
﻿Aaron Jones﻿ then followed the lead block of a motioning ﻿Dominique Dafney﻿ for a 12-yard gain into Buccaneers' territory.
The drive would stall at the Tampa Bay 6 with ﻿Mason Crosby﻿'s 24-yard field goal cutting the Bucs' lead to 14-10 with 4:59 left in the second quarter.
Linebacker ﻿Krys Barnes﻿ was shaken up on the next series, with ﻿Ty Summers﻿ replacing him as the Mike linebacker.
The Bucs converted a third-and-2 but two Brady incompletions and a 1-yard pass to Fournette gave Green Bay the ball back at its own 13 with 2:17 remaining in the first half.
Rodgers hit Lazard for 23 yards on third-and-6 but was picked off two plays later by Sean Murphy-Bunting.
The Buccaneers scored with a 39-yard touchdown pass to Scotty Miller to take a 21-10 lead into halftime.
Facing third-and-5 on the first drive of the second half, Rodgers hit Jones on a crosser for two yards before Jordan Whitehead forced the fumble.
Devin White recovered the ball and returned it to the Green Bay 8.
Jones was injured on the play.
Brady faked the handoff and hit Cam Brate in the back of the end zone for the 8-yard touchdown to push Tampa's lead to 28-10.
With Jones out of the game with a chest injury, Williams rushed for six yards on his first carry on the series.
It helped set up a 10-yard slant to ﻿Davante Adams﻿ to move the chains.
The Packers got down to the Tampa 24 after a 24-yard pass to Valdes-Scantling and a 10-yard pass to ﻿Equanimeous St. Brown﻿ on back-to-back plays.
A 16-yard pass to Lazard set up first-and-goal from the Bucs' 8-yard line.
Green Bay scored on the next play with Rodgers sniping a ball to ﻿Robert Tonyan﻿ for the touchdown.
The Packers finally got a takeaway of their own on the next series when Brady tried to force a pass to Evans, which Adrian Amos came over the top to pick off at the Green Bay 32.
Rodgers coaxed Ndamukong Suh into jumping offsides for the game's first penalty midway through the third quarter.
A Williams 7-yard run, a 4-yard pass to Adams and an 11-yard pass to AJ Dillon moved Green Bay into Tampa territory.
An 11-yard pass to Williams on third-and-3 took the ball down the Buccaneers' 14.
Adams caught another pass and took a shot to the helmet from Carlton Davis, setting up first-and-goal from the 2.
Tampa Bay defensive coordinator Todd Bowles sent the house at Rodgers on third-and-goal, and the two-time MVP found Adams on a quick slant for the touchdown to cut the deficit to 28-23 after the failed two-point conversion.
The defense propelled the Packers into the fourth quarter with ﻿Jaire Alexander﻿ intercepting Brady on back-to-back series.
Unfortunately for Green Bay, the offense would go three-and-out on both possessions.
A 29-yard pass to Rob Gronkowski on second-and-11 set up a 46-yard field goal for Ryan Succop that pushed the Bucs' lead to 31-23 with 4:42 remaining.
The Packers took over at their own 34 with 4:33 left.
﻿AJ Dillon﻿ kicked off the drive with a 9-yard run.
Valdes-Scantling moved over 100 yards receiving with a 29-yard pass down the middle of the field to the Tampa Bay 28.
Adams caught a pass for 11 yards to the Tampa Bay 8.
The drive would stall there, resulting in a Crosby 26-yard field goal to cut the deficit to 31-26 with just over two minutes remaining.
Two Fournette runs set up third-and-4 with 1:46 remaining.
Brady pulled back for playaction with Tyler Johnson drawing the defensive pass interference against Kevin King for the first down.

The first episode of Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers hosting “Jeopardy!” aired Monday.
The three-time MVP has nine more episodes airing over the next two weeks.
How did Rodgers do during his opening appearance?
It’s time to go to the tape to evaluate the performance.
Here’s a light-hearted breakdown of Rodgers’ first episode as guest host (note: spoilers ahead):
– Solid intro.
Looks confident, ready for the moment.
Possibly too much swaying back and forth.
He might be fighting some nerves, and that’s just fine.
– Terrific job reading the opening categories.
Noted the quotations, emphasized key or interesting words.
Sounds like a pro.
– Subtle but noteworthy pause between “answer” and “Daily Double,” providing the first of many tributes to Alex Trebek.
– He read the first Daily Double a little fast, probably out of excitement.
Still did an excellent job detailing the rules, the wager and also expanding the contestant’s answer to give the full name.
Strong work.
– Handled his first question without an answer from the contestants well.
Added a little humor.
This is the way.
He’s rolling now.
– He’s mixing up ways of confirming answers really well.
“That’s the state!” You can tell he watched plenty of Trebek.
His comfort level commanding this thing is rising.
– Got a little hurried at the first break but otherwise handled it well.
Figured this might be one of the toughest jobs.
You got the producer telling you to get to break, and then you have to execute the outro without rushing it.
He’ll get better at it.
– Strong job with the contestant interviews.
Got a few good stories.
Good transitions, but these things are always a little awkward.
Asked interesting follow-up questions.
And most importantly: a smooth re-entry into the game.
– Hearing him say “Go Bears!” – as in, Cal Bears – will rattle some Packers fans momentarily.
– Hilarious job reading the Larry David clue.
“Pretty, pretty good!” And he added a goofy pirate reference to confirm one answer.
Veteran stuff from the rookie host.
– Strong grade for the first round.
Can he keep the momentum going into Double Jeopardy?
– He has a good voice for this.
It’s definitely not overwhelming.
In fact, it’s probably understated.
But it’s also relaxing in a way.
Trebek had such a strong but soothing voice.
And he always knew when to use inflection and add a little spice or emphasis to certain words within clues.
We might want a little more energy out of the NFL quarterback.
– More of the same in the next round.
He does sound like a natural.
In command of the board, strong reading the clues, and gaining confidence in affirming answers.
He doesn’t sound out of place at all, and the game is flowing nicely.
– “But today is Brandon’s day.” Throwing out the dagger a little too soon, Aaron?
Might need to consult Wayne Larrivee about this.
– Scott, the two-day champion, threw him a curveball in Final Jeopardy, referencing the Packers’ decision to kick a field goal late in the NFC title game, and he handled it like a pro.
A big smile while he let the moment play out, and a funny response.
And a little jab: “Thanks for that.” It truly had a “Saturday Night Live” vibe to it.
Good stuff.
– Cool moment with Mr. Rogers being the answer to the final clue.
Bonus points for Rodgers adding something extra onto the end after the winner, Brandon, guessed right.
“Long-time TV host and a neighbor to so many.” Clever.
Good way to wrap up the show.
– Oh, maybe a little mistake at the end?
Background: “Jeopardy!” is matching the winner’s total and donating to the host’s charity of choice.
Brandon won $23,244.
Aaron said $26,244*.
He’ll go back to the tape and get that cleaned up for the next episode.
*It’s possible the $26,244 comes from Brandon’s $23,244 plus the second- and third-place winnings.
Probably my mistake here.
Whoops!
– Strong first episode.
The best compliment you could give him: He was prepared, charming, and he emulated Alex Trebek well while adding his own style and patented dry humor.
Of the guest hosts so far, he and Ken Jennings sound the most natural.
His preparation paid off in subtle but important ways.
I bet he’ll become more assertive with his voice and hosting style as we get into more and more episodes.
But in terms of first impressions?
This was terrific.

Free agent offensive lineman Lane Taylor visited his second team since the start of the new league year.
According to the league's transaction wire, Taylor – a starter for the Green Bay Packers to open the 2020 season – visited the Houston Texans on Monday.
Taylor visited the San Francisco 49ers last month.
Both teams likely want to check in on his recovery from the ACL injury he suffered in Week 1 of last year.
Taylor took a pay cut and returned to the Packers in 2020, and a strong summer earned him the starting job at right guard.
He was lost...
Daniel Jeremiah's latest mock draft for NFL.com has the Green Bay Packers getting help for the interior of the offensive line in the first round.
Jeremiah sent Alabama offensive lineman Landon Dickerson to the Packers at No.
29 overall.
From Jeremiah: "Dickerson is the best pure interior offensive linemen available.
I thought he might fall out of the first round after his ACL injury, but it appears his recovery is going smoothly.
He can step in following the departure of Corey Linsley."
Dickerson is Jeremiah's No.
40 overall prospect in the draft class, mostly due to injuries.
He suffered a torn...
Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers told "The Pat McAfee Show" that there is no update on his contract, a focal point of speculation this offseason, and he believes nothing has changed since when the team drafted quarterback Jordan Love in the first round last April.
The Packers, despite needing salary cap room this offseason, haven't restructured or extended Rodgers' contract, which the NFL MVP said is "really not a story."
"Nothing has really changed," Rodgers said Monday.
"My future is, a lot of it is out of my control."
Rodgers threw 48 touchdown passes and led the Packers to a 13-3...

packers.com senior writer
Hey everybody, thanks for logging on today.
I see questions already coming in, so keep them coming, and I'll get started.
Is there any update on the status of ﻿Allen Lazard﻿?
He was practicing on Monday (non-padded) and was running drills full speed from what I could see.
If he's a full participant in practice tomorrow (Thursday) during the padded workout, I would think that bodes well for his return.
Any word on ﻿Kevin King﻿?
He was practicing Monday as well.
Given LaFleur said he had a setback along the way in his recovery, his practice participation will be watched closely this week.
Nice trivia question in today's Inbox, Mike!
I didn't know the answer.
I'm sure those kinds of questions are difficult to come up with, but it'd be a fun little feature in Inbox going forward, even if it's only once a week.
Got any other trivia prepared for chat today?
Nothing off the top of my head.
I do write the weekly trivia question on our website every Tuesday.
It's in the Fans section, under Promotions, if you want to check it out.
How about DB our all-pro tackle?
Again, back at practice Monday, and I would think Thursday's padded practice will be the true test whether he's ready to return to the field.
Hi Mike, with the success of the depth on the O-Line since ﻿David Bakhtiari﻿ has been out, any chance they let him walk and use the money on ﻿Aaron Jones﻿ and ﻿Corey Linsley﻿ (who's combined salary would cost the same as Bak)?
I was asked this question in Inbox this morning, and to me there's a difference between a pending free agent, and a pending free agent who's one of the absolute best at a premier position, like Bakhtiari is at left tackle.
Four-time All-Pro, and still going plenty strong.
I have to believe he's the Packers' top priority.
That guarantees nothing, of course, because you never know how these negotiations are going to go, but I just don't see the Packers letting him walk, not when he's protecting the blindside of the franchise QB.
What role do you expect ﻿Christian Kirksey﻿ to play now that ﻿Krys Barnes﻿ and ﻿Kamal Martin﻿ have shown what they can do?
That's a really good question.
Kirksey is a veteran who quickly became a leader on this team, by all accounts.
If he resumes a regular first- and second-down role, perhaps they find specific roles for the other two and they'll all play a fair amount.
It could be an evolving situation.
Hi Mike.
We hear ﻿Aaron Rodgers﻿ talk all the time about some of his favorite teammates he's played with.
Not asking you to name names and get banned from Hop Sing, but were you ever aware of a set of teammates who just did not like each other?
In my experience, if certain players didn't like other ones, they just didn't interact much and kept to themselves about it.
It's a big locker room.
No one wants to disrupt anything.
It's not too hard to co-exist with someone you don't care for on a 53-man roster.
Do you think the D-line really needed some help as the media is suggesting?
﻿Kenny Clark﻿ plays like a first rounder, ﻿Tyler Lancaster﻿ seems solid in the middle, plus ﻿Kingsley Keke﻿ and ﻿Montravius Adams﻿ are on the rise.
What am I missing?
I'm of the opinion you never have enough big guys in the trenches who can do a tough job.
Young players are going to be more inconsistent.
Veteran players provide stability.
But veteran players also cost more.
It's a tough balancing act.
We've had a few COVID cases recently on the Packers team.
Seems like more rookies than veterans.
Is the organization or the community doing contact tracing to determine how these players came into contact?
I'm sure they've investigated it with the infected players, but they're not going to make that information public.
Obviously our offense is "new school" and very successful.
But is our defense too "old school" which doesn't match up well with today's game?
I don't think so.
When the defense has struggled, it's mostly struggled with stopping the run, which is not exactly new school football.
Just wanted to point out that it is currently 11:11 on 11/11.
That is all.
OK then.
Rogers thinks the NFL COVID protocols are for show.
Have you heard any other grumblings from other players?
I think that's a mischaracterization of his comments.
The other day he was just pointing out how incongruous some of the rules appear to be, like practicing on the football field for 2 hours with the whole team but then having plexiglass between you and the locker next to you.
I can see how that doesn't seem to make sense.
I think the argument on the other side is the desire to limit risk and exposure whenever possible, which isn't possible on the field but is possible everywhere else.
None of this is simple.
My brother Dan is a Green Beret in the U.S. Army.
Also a recent father of two children under 2 years old, he's a hero of mine.
I know he'd appreciate a shoutout in your column.
Would love to thank all our active military and veterans today!
Absolutely.
A shout-out to all veterans today.

What adjustments does the defense need to make to have the Smith Bros. causing the opposing QB to make a bad decision?
The more effective the Packers are at stopping the run, the more they can get after QBs and potentially force turnovers.
Pressure on the QB is responsible for a large percentage of turnovers, but you have to put the offense in those tough spots first.
I read an article, can't remember from whom, that said the problem with the Packers D isn't that they're soft but that they're slow.
Do you think that's the culprit of the leaky run D?
I don't think there's a speed issue.
I think overall this defense is faster than it's been in some of the other playoff years.
LaFleur has mentioned multiple times bringing energy and effort on every play.
The defense has to find and set a standard, and keep it there.
It hasn't done that, which is why the unit as a whole has been so up and down.
You said your favorite all-time player is W. Payton.
Who's your all-time favorite Packer?
From my youth, probably James Lofton.
Do you think with the cap number dropping so much for next year, will there be a lot of high priced players taking a cut in salary?
That very well could happen around the league.
Teams are going to be in a cap crunch, and players will have to decide if they want to restructure deals to stay with their current team, or be let go and test the market to see what they can get.
We're going to be entering uncharted waters in free agency come next March.
Our defense was #1 in QB pressures last year, we're #32 this year with largely the same cast.
Are you seeing schematic changes the rest of us don't see?
Was Blake Martinez coveting a lot of holes that the current cast isn't, so we've had to be less aggressive?
Something else going on?
The Packers just haven't gotten after QBs as well as they did last year, which mostly comes down to winning one-on-ones.
They have faced a lot of QBs that get the ball out quickly a majority of the time, but that's not the full explanation for the pressures being down after 8 games.
For those of us who haven't followed Jacksonville this year, does their 1-7 record say it all, or is there more to the story?
Anything the Packers need to watch out for on Sunday?
Robinson and Chark on offense are darn good players.
They can hit you for an explosive play at any time.
Myles Jack is the Jaguars' best defensive player.
He's really, really good, but they don't have a lot of other top defensive pieces surrounding him.
Doesn't Lazard have to be added to the roster this week?
I believe so, yes, but I haven't checked the dates specifically related to the rule.
Where in SW Wisconsin did you grow up?
Platteville.
My favorite Packer in the 2010s was Jordy Nelson, but ﻿Davante Adams﻿ is starting to really command respect as the best Packer receiver in recent history.
Is this recency bias, or are we seeing something very special continue to develop in 17?
What does he need to do to cement himself in the Packer Hall of Fame one day?
Adams is special.
Rodgers has said many times, including in a big sit-down interview I did with him and Adams for a Yearbook piece a couple of years ago, that of all the great receivers he's played with, Adams has the most athletic talent.
That's saying something, because Driver, Jennings, Jones, Nelson, Cobb had plenty of talent, but Adams just brings more to the table.
I thought I saw this game was 'flexed' to 3:25, but I keep seeing noon starting time listed.
Can you clarify?
It was next week's game against the Colts that was flexed to 3:25 p.m. CT.
This week's game is still at noon.
How can the league already be drawing up a cap number when we don't know what is to happen with COVID/cures?
Nothing is set in stone, but the league already decided the cap hits due to the lost revenue from this season will be spread out over multiple years, and they basically already announced a ballpark figure for next year's cap.
When all the financials are sorted out after the season, they'll figure out how to spread the rest of the cap hits.
Obviously still very early on, but what record do you think will earn a team the #1 seed in the NFC?
I think it's going to take 13-3.
If it's 12-4, there will definitely be tiebreakers involved to decide it.
Going back to the II question on what has Rodgers not done within reason.
Is catching a touchdown pass within reason?
End around thrown across to the QB for a TD.
That's not really what I had in mind, but perhaps we'll see that someday.
I think the evolution of the game (playing nickel and dime with very few linemen ahead of you against speedy receivers, and monster ends and backs) made playing inside linebacker in the NFL one of the toughest jobs.
Which Packers LB do you think has the best size/speed combo?
On the current roster?
It's so hard to say.
When Kirksey was playing, Martin was out, and vice versa.
Barnes has been in and out of the lineup.
There hasn't been enough for me to really tell yet.
What will it take for the Pack to continue to create turnovers?
Get the offense in difficult down-and-distance situations.
It's easier to get after the QB on third-and-8 than third-and-3.
I don't really remember the last time we played the Jags, but I feel like I remember it being an L?
What was Rodgers' stay line for that game?
Rodgers is 2-1 vs. the Jaguars, losing his first year as a starter in '08 but winning in '12 and '16.
I wouldn't say he's had any stats that have really stood out either way.
The TD throw to Adams at the end of the first half of the game in '16 was one of the top 10 throws of his career, though.
He had a defender draped all over him trying to sack him and he still launched the ball 40 yards.
The Packers must stop Robinson , who is a fine running back and they have to be prepared for a lot of blitzing if they are to have success against Jags.
Also their receiving core has talent.
I guess what I'm saying is that Pack can't take Jacksonville too lightly.
What is your take on these issues?
The Packers are the better team, but they can't just show up.
They have to play well, play their game, and take care of business.
If you don't play well in this league, it's very hard to win.
You can play well and lose, that happens.
But I don't see the Packers playing well and losing to this team.
Is it possible that any other games will be flexed this year?
I'm specifically eyeing the noon CST game at Detroit on 12/13.
There are certainly possibilities for more games to be flexed, but the Packers are already slated for SNF vs. the Bears and Titans, and the Eagles game is at 3:25.
The Detroit game you mention could move if the Lions stay in the hunt, I suppose.
What rookie do you think can really come on the back half of the season?
Barnes and/or Martin would be the best candidates.
﻿Jon Runyan﻿ could, too, but the Packers would only turn to him up front in case of injury.
Same with ﻿Vernon Scott﻿, who is currently injured.
Can you pinpoint any significant special teams' play this year?
Nothing leaps out yet to me, except consistency.
Maybe that's good?
Nothing dynamic, nothing too detrimental.
They've had a couple of kickoff returns out to the 30 and beyond, allowed a couple as well.
Neither side has had a punt return longer than 14 yards.
The blocked punt and failed recovery of the onside kick in Houston were the worst moments, but fortunately the Packers were playing with a big enough lead they didn't prove too costly.
Has a pending free agent contract ever been signed that is based on a percentage of the cap for the upcoming year versus a hard $ amount?
This would seem like a good way to sign your pending top free agents without causing big issues if the cap drops.
I'm not aware of that happening.
I have no idea if teams would entertain that for the next few years to navigate the uncertainty or not.
Stay tuned I guess.
Who was the better receiver James Lofton or Sterling Sharpe?
I liked Lofton but Sterling was amazing.
It was too bad his career was cut short.
They were both fabulous players with great careers, and yes, Sterling's was too short.
But I had a conversation with John Dorsey here years ago and he said from a scouting standpoint, the explosiveness and danger to defenses that Lofton presented were just hard to compare.
I have really enjoyed seeing Runyan get after it on the o-line.
He reminds me a lot of his dad, and I think he has a very bright NFL career ahead of him.
He's off to a great start for a young man who has learned a new position right away in the NFL.
I think the Packers found a keeper there.
Adding to the special teams topic: It's interesting that ﻿Tyler Ervin﻿ was signed to get the return game going, but now he's moved more into offensive schemes and hasn't been returning as much.
I think that's been related to his hand/wrist injury more than anything else.
Correct me if I'm wrong...when the Packers beat San Francisco, wasn't that the first time Rodgers beat them at San Francisco?
No, Rodgers and the Packers won at San Fran in 2015, the first year of the new stadium out there.
What are your favorite things about Mr. Walter Payton?
Well, getting to meet him in person as a kid and get his autograph multiple times was pretty cool.
But I also just loved the way he played the game.
He was tough as nails and took on anyone and everyone.
And he loved every minute of it.
The ultimate competitor.
All right, I'm going to have to sign off.
Thanks for the participation as always and we'll talk again next week.
Take care, Mike

Hey there, hope everybody had a great Christmas.
Thanks for logging on today.
Let's go ahead and get started.
Great job on WYMM once again Mike.
Do you expect to see any of the defensive changes used last against Henry and the Titans to be used this week against Montgomery and the Bears?
Thanks for checking out the segment.
The film was really interesting to go through.
To your question, it really depends on how the Bears employ their personnel.
If Chicago uses a bunch of two- and three-TE sets, then why not.
But if the Bears are going to go three wide and try to run Montgomery that way, you still have to match personnel on the perimeter.
I know, I know.
Just beat the Bears.
However, if you will allow this indulgence, if the Packers do beat the Bears they will have the same record as last season's.
Please compare and contrast.
This offense is in a completely different place than last year's.
It's one of the best in the league.
That wasn't the case a year ago.
Defensively, the Packers are coming on strong late here, which is a good sign.
Last year's unit might have been more consistent overall, but we saw it going the wrong way later in the year.
Special teams aren't as sound and reliable.
That's pretty obvious.
Good morning, Mike!
We've been hearing a lot about the Bears' offensive resurgence.
How has their defense been playing recently?
It's pretty good, but I don't think it's been as good as the past couple of years, certainly not like the '18 team that won the division.
The Lions put up a bunch of points on them right before this recent winning streak started.
Minnesota moved the ball pretty well on them, too.
Hicks, Mack, Jackson, Roquan Smith are all top-flight players, and Nichols is really coming on.
But overall they've been more vulnerable than other years we've seen, in my opinion.
Mike, thanks for your no-nonsense answer today in the Inbox about the Packers identity.
I think this concept is a holdover from Vic's days here, but it's not one I could ever get behind.
As far as I can tell, it's a fancy way to explain how a team wins games.
Because you never hear talk about a team's identity when they lose.
I didn't mean to be dismissive, but I think it is an outdated concept to a certain extent because these young coaches like LaFleur, Shanahan, McVay, Flores and a bunch of others do a lot more game-planning week-to-week based on opponents.
It's just how the game is played now.
Mike...are the roster rules the same during playoffs as they were during the season?
I'm not aware of anything different.
Hi Mike.
Hope you had a great Christmas.
What did you think about the Packers playing ﻿Krys Barnes﻿ in 95% of the snap count against the Titans compared to ﻿Christian Kirksey﻿ and ﻿Kamal Martin﻿'s 20%?
Seemed like we were playing lots of man as well and it seemed to work fantastic.
The Packers have decided Barnes is their best inside LB, and he's earned it.
I think I mentioned it a week ago and then it showed up again vs. the Titans -- Kirksey seems to be a higher-impact player with fewer snaps, less of a workload.
They're getting more with less, and that's not a bad thing.
Martin is a real wild card at that position.
He flies around like crazy, and when he's in the right spot or makes the right move, he can make a high-impact play as well, but he also can be a little reckless.
Ultimately do you think it will benefit the Packers having so much riding on this game vs having it wrapped last week?
I don't know.
We'll just have to see.
If the Packers win and get out of Chicago healthy, all is well.

Could Trubisky be called consistent yet?
He's playing better than he has, but the Bears are also staying committed to the run game, which is helping him tremendously.
He also threw a brutal INT in the end zone last week in Jacksonville on first down in the red zone, the kind of miscue that got him benched in the first place.
I've always felt the key to defending him was keeping him in the pocket and not letting him run around and use his legs.
You don't rush Trubisky to sack him, you rush him to hem him in and make him throw from the pocket.
Are there any playoff teams you'd prefer to see at Lambeau?
I wouldn't mind an opponent lacking a winning record, or the Rams without Goff.
Let's hope we're studying the possibilities next week with the Packers getting rested up.
The Packers were able to run the ball effectively against the Bears the last time out.
But Chicago was also missing Akiem Hicks.
How big a difference do you think his presence makes?
It's significant.
The Packers came out in the last game and exploited Hicks' absence from the get-go.
It was obvious on the first drive of the game.
I expect the Bears to be more stout against the run than last time, but that doesn't mean the Packers can't still be effective running the ball.
Is Adrian Amos playing dimelinebacker here to stay?
It's in his arsenal but he's not playing that spot on every snap.
Pettine moves Amos around all over the place, but yes, he's certainly playing more dime LB since Raven Greene﻿'s injury.
Our offensive line has struggled through all our injuries but two, Lane Taylor and now Rick Wagner﻿.
How does the health of the Bears starting line compare to what they'll field on Sunday?
I haven't seen any injury updates from Chicago yet this week.
Stay tuned I guess.
What makes Montgomery so successful?
What do you see as his best trait?
He's decisive with his cuts, and he's got a decent amount of power for a back who's not overly big.
He's a pretty versatile guy, as far as running between the tackles, bouncing outside, catching passes.
He's a really good all-around player.
Hey Mike, thanks for the weekly chat per usual!
Assuming Jamaal Williams comes back healthy this week, do you foresee AJ Dillon getting more of his carries, or do you think that'd be purely situational?
I'm not saying Dillon gets 20-plus carries again, but I don't see him going back to just a few after that performance Sunday night.
When a guy plays like that, you have to reward him.
﻿Aaron Rodgers﻿ said recently that Soldier Field is one of his favorite places to play.
Any idea why?
The only stadium where he's won an NFC championship game?
I'm sure it's partly the memories from that game and the finale in '13 with the dramatic fourth down.
It was also where the Packers played in '14 and won big right after his "RELAX" comment about the offense.
What do you think is key to win the game on Sunday?
Contain Montgomery, keep Trubisky in the pocket, stay balanced on offense, and don't let the Bears dominate on special teams.
Hi Mike.. happy holidays.
i am wondering if the Packers feel like they hold the future of Trubisky in their hands this weekend?
might they scheme differently if they feel like they want Trubisky to appear acceptable to the Bears organization?
In the immortal words of Herm Edwards: You play to win the game.
The Day After The Titans Game, The National Media Seemed Bumbed Out When Talking About The Outcome....
I think the national folks were hoping for a better game, something down-to-the-wire in the snow.
Should there be any concerns with our record after a bye week these last years?
I know we beat Seattle last year, but our form after a bye worries me!
I hear this a lot, and I just don't think it's valid.
The Packers' post-bye struggles have had way more to do with the opponents they've been playing in those situations (SF last year, TB this year) than anything else, in my opinion.
The playoff bye is huge.
You get to rest up, get healthy, and not put your guys at risk of getting injured for a week.
Every other team is taking that risk to advance.
And only having to win 2 games to get to the Super Bowl instead of 3 speaks for itself.
This is a crazy league.
You do whatever you can to get the odds in your favor.
What's the story on ﻿Jace Sternberger﻿?
He's been out with a concussion for like four weeks or so.
Is that unusual?
This is his second significant concussion in two years in the NFL.
He had one last year as a rookie in training camp that kept him out for a while, too.
I hope he's doing OK. You hate to see that.
﻿Darnell Savage﻿, Amos and ﻿Jaire Alexander﻿ are allowing more Guys to load the box.
If they continue to perform at their current levels I am confident we can limit any RB to 100 yards regardless of score.
It's so important they stay healthy.
The Packers' secondary is playing at a very high level right now.
It's what they envisioned as they've remade the group over the last few years.
Do you think that Dillion is a volume running back like Adrian Peterson.
The more he carries the better he gets?
I think most running backs are like that.
It helps to get a feel for the game, read the defense on the fly, etc.
In this league, you just have to do your best to make it count when you're in there.
So, if the Saints and Seahawks winning and our team fails in Chicago, the driver seat going to the Saints.
It is very unlikely, that both (Packers and Saints) are going to lose!
Is it possible that the Seahawks rest their starters?
That can't be a serious question.
Would you expect to see more of ﻿Dominique Dafney﻿ again this week?
I was surprised how many snaps he got on Sunday.
LaFleur has found a role for him, and he's come through.
This offense always has a place for reliable, productive tight ends, and Dafney has given them a third behind ﻿Robert Tonyan﻿ and ﻿Marcedes Lewis﻿ with Sternberger out.
The trubiskaholics are back on a bender now, I bet.
I just don't know what to think of him.
Looks great and has so much promise at times, then channels his inner Jay Cutler sometimes...
The Bears are trying to figure it out, too.
Other than the playoff game two years ago vs. Philly, which he would have won had Parkey made the kick, this is probably the biggest game of his career.
Loving the Lafleur offense right about now.
There's plenty to like.
They've had their lulls during the season in certain games, but there were no lulls last week.
Staying committed to the running game with these backs I think is the best tonic to cure the lulls.
How Do We Get Rid Of The 2011 Homefield-advantage failure Trama?
It'll be the playoffs, where anything can happen.
The Falcons had the 1 seed twice, in 2010 and 2012, before they got it a third time and finally made it to a Super Bowl.
It guarantees nothing.
But like I said before, you play the odds, and having the 1, especially this year, increases your odds.
To me the importance of having the No.
1 seed this year cannot be overstated: 1) An extra week of rest while the other teams are fighting for their lives, 2) One less game to have to win to get the SB, 3) Playing at home throughout the playoffs, 4) Always playing the lowest seeded team left in the mix.
Bingo.
Please do not overlook the job the offensive line is doing in opening up holes in the running game, as well as protecting #12.
They deserve a ton of credit.
No question.
I've been saying all year it's remarkable what the offensive line has done given the injuries and all the shuffling around, almost weekly.
This is the best performance by a Packers' O-line, in my view, since '14, but that group had every starter for every game except one.
This group has done it a very different way.
It will be good when Williams returns healthy but I don't think it's wise to try to split carries between 3 backs.
Do they stay with a two back rotation or try to split it up three ways?
I don't know.
We'll have to see what LaFleur decides.
And it may come down to someone looking stronger in the given game, the hot hand idea.
Don't you feel like the game boils down to the Packers offense against the Bears defense?
If the Packers score 30-plus, which they've done in I believe 11 of 15 games this season, I don't see the Bears scoring enough to keep up, if that's what you're asking.
So what has been the key improvements on defense that has allowed that unit to blossom?
Savage is a different player than he was during the first half of the season.
He's really growing in Year 2.
﻿Kenny Clark﻿ is also a different player.
He missed a month and wasn't himself when he first came back from the groin injury.
﻿Dean Lowry﻿ has played better up front compared to earlier in the season.
﻿Preston Smith﻿, too.
﻿Za'Darius Smith﻿ keeps getting a sack a game pretty much, Amos is super steady, as is Alexander.
The emergence of Barnes, as mentioned earlier, and getting more from Kirksey with a smaller workload.
There's a lot that has gone into it.
Will Dillon be like Starks in 2010?
I don't look at it like that because the Packers have such an established No.
1 back in ﻿Aaron Jones﻿.
Back in '10, Brandon Jackson was the de facto No.
1 back and had 700 yards rushing.
That's it.
Starks filled a huge void.
Dillon is adding to a lot of potency the Packers already possess.
This is about as healthy as we could expect for this time of year, isn't it?
Yes.
Shhh.
Does The Team Have A "Flat Tire" Anywhere On The Team That Needs Fixing?
The special teams are still very up and down.
After some rough weeks, the performance vs. Carolina was solid.
Then we saw the blocked FG last week.
That phase needs to be more reliable and consistent.
I don't have to remind this crowd what a fake FG and onside kick can do to you in the playoffs.
Hey Mike, regardless of whether or not it truly was a factor, and since LaFleur did appear to be excited about the ﻿Jordan Love﻿ pick, do you think the perception that it lighted a fire under Rodgers to have the MVP season he's having enhances LaFleur's chances of getting coach of the year?
I don't think that should have anything to do with it whatsoever.
LaFleur should have gotten stronger consideration last year.
He took a sub-.500 team to 13-3 without his QB playing lights out, like he is now.
If you're not going to give him credit for that, then he deserves credit for helping get Rodgers back to an MVP level and keeping this team rolling.
That's how I see it.
Who do you think has the best chance of beating the Chiefs in the AFC?
KC will be a tough out, obviously, but I think Buffalo has the best shot.
That team strikes me as one that plays with no fear, starting with Josh Allen.
Can Dillon pass block well enough to earn more snaps?
We'll see.
That's the next step to rounding out his game, which is not unusual for a rookie RB.
I'm amused by the sports commentators talk about seed swap scenarios.
I find myself saying, "but none of that will matter because the Pack will win to get the first seed".
Naivety or faith?
Call it whatever you want, but I take nothing for granted.
The Packers were an inch from getting the 1 seed last year, but were also down big at Detroit and almost blew the bye altogether.
You just never know how these things are going to play out.
Chicago has everything on the line, too.
Who would make the toughest matchup in an NFC final?
Just beat the Bears.
That's all I've got time for today, folks.
Happy New Year to everyone.
Take care, Mike

Packers President/CEO
On the first Saturday of every month, Mark will write about a topic of interest to Packers fans and the organization, and then answer five fan questions.
Fans are encouraged to email Mark with their name and hometown at: MurphyTakes5@packers.com.
At their annual meeting on Tuesday, NFL owners voted to expand the regular season from 16 to 17 games.
This was not a move that executives from the league office and the clubs took lightly.
The potential move had been discussed and planned for several years and was a key part of the negotiations with the NFLPA on a new collective bargaining agreement, as well as with our media partners on the recently announced extensions.
The last time the league increased the number of games in the season was 1978, when the number of regular-season games went from 14 to 16.
On a side note, I was a rookie in 1977 when there were six preseason and 14 regular-season games.
I remember thinking how long the preseason was in 1977 and felt like I'd already played a whole college season.
I actually thought the move to 16 games was good for players since it shortened the preseason.
The biggest concern with the expanded season is the potential impact on the health and safety of our players.
There is no question there will be more wear and tear on the players' bodies with an extra game (and the reality is very few players played in all preseason and regular games).
However, there have been a number of changes in recent years to make practices and games safer for our players.
J.C. Tretter, former Packer and current president of the NFLPA, has been at the center of these decisions and recently sent a letter to players reminding them that the NFLPA received substantial benefits and improved working conditions in return for agreeing to the 17-game regular season.
According to NFLPA data, this past year NFL players experienced a 23% decrease in time missed with injury, a 30% reduction in concussions, the lowest figures for ACL tears and lower extremity strains in five years, and a 45% decrease in heat-related illnesses.
Also, I think both players and management learned a lot from last year's training camp schedule, and will incorporate permanently many of the changes installed last year due to the pandemic.
The longer strength and conditioning period and longer ramp-up period resulted in fewer injuries for players during training camp.
In addition, under the new schedule, there will be no preseason games the week before the start of the regular season in order to give players time to heal any injuries prior to the start of the season.
Also, in my mind, a big issue has been the poor quality of our preseason games.
Over time, fewer and fewer starters are playing in the preseason games, and the games feel more like scrimmages.
The games still serve a purpose, though, in giving younger players game experience and allowing general managers to better evaluate players.
Trading one preseason game for one regular-season game is a good trade-off that will be a benefit for our fans.
The 17-game schedule provides other benefits to the league.
The extra game gives the league more flexibility when it comes to international games (all teams will be required to give up one home game, during a season when they would have had nine home games, over an eight-year period).
The new schedule will also have more interconference games (this year the Packers will play at Kansas City) and will provide interesting matchups that will be good for fans.
The new season structure was also important to our television partners.
Under the new media agreements, the networks will have more flexibility in scheduling games, to ensure better matchups, which will also benefit fans.
In addition, more of the games will be on streaming services which will allow fans who have cut the cord on their cable systems to continue to watch NFL games.
Moreover, the new agreements will pay the league significantly more (75%) than the current TV deals, which will benefit both players and owners (under the new CBA, the players will receive a higher percentage of the revenue as well as a kicker for the new media deals).
Finally, the length of the media deals and the CBA (both are 11 years) provides the NFL with unprecedented stability.
Now, on to your questions…
Buddy from WI
Mark, I have been a fan of the Packers for over 35 years and as such the NFL.
However, in the last 15 years my fandom for the NFL has waned with each passing year.
Instead of watching games all day on Sunday, I simply watch the Packers and that's it.
My interest level dropping coincides with Roger Goodell taking over.
I know that you have a good working relationship with him but many fans, myself included, feel he's done more harm than good to the NFL from a fan and player experience.
As someone who played football for 15 years of my life, I can say that some of the rule changes have been good for the game (e.g.
the health of the players) but those changes were really forced upon the NFL.
However, many of the decisions have been made in direct contrast to player safety.
The games overseas, the Thursday night games on a weekly basis and now the 17th regular-season game.
Roger and other owners/executives such as yourself have said these decisions were made in interest of the fans, quality of the games and player safety.
Those of us who are able to look past all the fluff, political-type statements can quite plainly see these changes are being made with only one thing in mind: the almighty dollar.
Now, I fully understand that the NFL is a business and the goal is to increase profits, but at what point do you stop putting money ahead of player safety and health?
When I played in my early 30s, I would play a game on a Saturday and I wouldn't feel "normal" again until at least the following Thursday.
Now I didn't have millions of dollars to help me rehabilitate all the bumps and bruises, but I take as good of care of my body as a non-millionaire can and the game wasn't at the speed of the NFL.
These players take a beating and every week some old player walks out the tunnel of some NFL stadium and is barely able to walk among other issues.
Other than money, how can the NFL and people like you, a former player, justify adding a 17th regular-season game, Thursday games regularly and playing games overseas?
At some point you need to put the health of the players ahead of money.
Sunday night games, Monday Night Football and Thanksgiving Day games used to be special and I looked forward to them...now, they are meaningless games that I don't watch unless the Packers are playing.
Heck, the Super Bowl doesn't mean a whole lot either.
Thanks for providing an honest, non-political speak response.
Your columns have been enjoyable to read.
Thanks, Buddy.
I appreciate your thoughts on this topic – especially from someone who played football for 15 years and into your early 30s.
I never played a down in my 30s – Washington cut me on my 30th birthday!
I addressed many of your concerns in the column, but I would add a few thoughts.
First, I don't know when you played, but the game is significantly different than when I played.
We are much smarter now about how to train and practice to keep the players fresh and healthy.
George Allen and other coaches from that era viewed training camp as a way to test how players would react when pushed to their limit.
We also had two-a-day practices at least five days a week, with a walk-through in the evenings.
George also didn't believe in water breaks – but at least the trainers would sneak ice cubes to us!
Most teams now only have one practice a day in camp and rarely practice more than three days in a row in pads.
In addition, the practices during the regular season have significantly changed over time with only one padded practice a week and less time on the field.
I think a big part of our success over the last two years has been that Matt LaFleur is very much in tune with our players' health, and has been willing to adjust our practice schedules to help keep players safe.
With regard to the Thursday games, the league studies have shown that there is not an increase in injuries in Thursday games, although it does certainly give players less time to recover and some players are unable to play who might have been able to play with more rest.
The league policy has been that teams will not have more than one short-week game a season.
Also, the extra time off after a Thursday game does give players extra time to heal – almost like a mini bye.
As a former player for Washington, I thought the Cowboys always hosting a Thanksgiving game gave them a huge advantage going into the end of the season.
With regard to the international games, all teams will have a bye after these games if they want.
Also, I know that players enjoy playing games in London.
Most NFL players were not able to study abroad in college because of their football commitments, so these games provide a great cultural experience for them.
From "Notop64"
So how come the junior conference got dibs for the first year of No.
17?
It has been many years since I've seen someone refer to the AFC as the junior conference, Notop64.
You are showing your age.
I don't think there was an official reason given for giving the AFC the home games this year.
One factor may have been that the AFC has two teams in new stadiums (the Chargers and Raiders) and neither team had any fans in the stands last year, while the NFC only has one team with a new stadium (the Rams).
Regardless, it will even out over eight years with all teams having four home games and four away games.
Interestingly, in the ninth year, the NFC North teams will host the AFC West teams to reverse the pattern from the first eight years.
Robert from Saginaw, MI
Mark, does the new exclusive Thursday night TV package on Amazon Prime include the season-opening Thursday night game and the Thanksgiving night games?
Good question, Robert.
No, these two games – the NFL Kickoff game on the opening Thursday night and the Thanksgiving night game have always been separate from the league's Thursday night package and will remain so.
I believe both of these games will remain on NBC.
The partnership with Amazon will be interesting to follow over the course of the media deals.
As mentioned above, more and more people are no longer watching traditional television and the league and Amazon saw that they could help each other with this partnership.
A question from Peter
Mr. Murphy: When it is reported that an NFL team has had a virtual meeting, with a potential draftee, it does not mean that they are looking at him as a possible first-round draft choice, rather that they are interested in drafting him somewhere in the draft; am I correct?
I will await your response.
With the pandemic, things have obviously been very different the last two years when it comes to the process of evaluating and drafting college players.
The Combine is normally a time when teams are able to interview potential draftees in person.
Last year, the Combine was held as normal and then things across the League quickly shut down.
At the Combine, the League limits the number of interviews, so teams have to make strategic decisions on how best to utilize the interviews.
With the virtual interviews, there are no limits to how many players you can interview, but you can't interview any one player more than five times.
To answer your question, no, when we interview a player it doesn't necessarily mean that we are interested in him as a first-round pick.
Typically, we try to interview players that we think will be available when we are picking throughout the draft.
Also, we might use an interview on a player where we may have questions regarding his character and would like to see how he responds to our concerns.
Bob from Colorado
Friends of mine with children have commented on the lack of endless rounds of colds and flu children bring home from school that infect the rest of the family members.
We assume the preventive measures taken because of COVID-19 have limited the spread of other diseases too.
In the past, the flu and various colds have caused players to miss games.
Going forward, do you see the Packers organization continuing many of these COVID-related protocols to protect the team's health?
You raise a good point, Bob.
Last year, numerous protocols were put in place by the league to keep our players safe from COVID-19.
These protocols also helped stop the spread of other diseases, as you note.
(I may be old-school, but I hope none of our players ever miss a game because they have a cold).
As we look ahead to our offseason and the start of training camp (and then the preseason and regular season), I anticipate that the protocols will be a topic of negotiations between the league office and the NFLPA.
The offseason programs can start on April 19.
Again, this will be negotiated, but it will likely start virtually and then transition to in-person practices.
For the in-person practices, the protocols from last season will likely remain in place.
Obviously, a key going forward will be the vaccinations – not only getting a high percentage of our players vaccinated, but also encouraging a high percentage of people across the country to get vaccinated.
We cannot require players to get vaccinated, but will strongly encourage them (as well as all our employees) to do so.
Starting on Monday, all Wisconsin residents 16 and over are eligible to get vaccinated.
Bellin Health has set up a vaccination site in our Atrium, so it couldn't be easier for our players and employees to get the vaccine.
The sooner we get a high percentage (85%) of people vaccinated, we can get back to a sense of normalcy and hopefully have Lambeau Field full in the fall.

The Green Bay Packers created the NFL’s No.
1 scoring offense in 2020 without making a significant addition at the wide receiver position.
Although the Packers will return every receiver from last season, and veteran Devin Funchess is back after opting out of 2020, the position will remain in focus as the 2021 draft approaches.
A fascinating question to ponder: what type of receiver do the Packers actually need?
Does this team want a traditional style receiver, or more of a gadget, run-after-catch type?
There probably isn’t a wrong answer.
While every receiver from last year will return, the Packers do not currently have a player at the position signed past 2021.
So long-term depth here is a legitimate concern, even if an extension for Davante Adams is likely and Allen Lazard will be easier to retain 2022 as a restricted free agent.
Funchess, Marquez Valdes-Scantling and Equanimeous St. Brown will both be unrestricted free agents after next season, and there is no prospect waiting in the wings behind them.
Adding a receiver who can play most of the wide receiver positions on the field will soon become a priority, creating an argument for targeting a traditional style receiver in this year’s draft.
But there is also an intriguing argument for a gadget type.
The Matt LaFleur offense is begging for an explosive and versatile receiver who can handle all the gadget responsibilities of the scheme, play snaps in the slot and create easy yards on staple plays.
Ben Fennell of NFL Network makes a strong case for injecting the LaFleur offense with a new element at receiver:
LaFleur's Horizontal Pass Game/RPO offense makes life for WRs so easy!
Meshes, Drives, Rubs, RPO Slants…
Open % = 3yds Nearest DefenderWide Open % = 5yds Nearest Defender#Packers were #1 in BOTH categories in 2020 via @NextGenStats.
Now add a YAC nightmare to this scheme… pic.twitter.com/pJTuwBuh09
— Ben Fennell (@BenFennell_NFL) March 31, 2021
The Packers don’t currently have a player of this type on the roster.
Tyler Ervin, a running back by trade, moonlighted as the gadget receiver to start last season.
His explosiveness and elusiveness provided tangible impact, even as a pre-snap decoy.
Defenses had to respect his horizontal speed on jet motions.
He rarely got the ball, but even his presence on the field opened up space for others.
When Ervin went down with multiple injuries, the Packers signed Tavon Austin, an original gadget type, to handle the role to finish the season.
The idea here is that giving this job to a legitimate receiver could both enhance the pre-snap effect and provide new and easy ways for LaFleur and Aaron Rodgers to get the ball into the hands of playmakers.
Quick throws.
Opportunities in space.
Easy yards.
As Fennell mentioned above, the Packers offense is loaded with concepts that could be perfect for this type of receiver.
This draft looks strong in gadget types.
Kadarius Toney, Rondale Moore, Elijah Moore, Amari Rodgers, Dyami Brown, Jaelon Darden, Demetric Felton and Ihmir Smith-Marsette all fit the profile.
They all provide the explosive athletic profile and strong run after the catch abilities required of maximizing the production value of the gadget spot, especially in an offense like LaFleur’s.
Of course, a gadget type might not be a full-time player.
And most of the gadget types could struggle in a fully diversified role, limiting their overall value.
Drafting a player for a very specific role could create more long-term building plans at the position.
But it’s certainly interesting to imagine the Packers adding a gadget type, providing another element to an already dominant offense and giving LaFleur the exact type of weapon his scheme might need to operate at full capacity.
Despite not taking a receiver in last year’s draft, the Packers are almost certain to take at least one in 2021.
Maybe general manager Brian Gutekunst can find developmental options that fit both profiles.
It will be fascinating to see which type – traditional or gadget – the Packers target if they use a high pick at receiver.
A strong argument can be made for both styles.

Free agent offensive lineman Lane Taylor visited his second team since the start of the new league year.
According to the league's transaction wire, Taylor – a starter for the Green Bay Packers to open the 2020 season – visited the Houston Texans on Monday.
Taylor visited the San Francisco 49ers last month.
Both teams likely want to check in on his recovery from the ACL injury he suffered in Week 1 of last year.
Taylor took a pay cut and returned to the Packers in 2020, and a strong summer earned him the starting job at right guard.
He was lost...
Daniel Jeremiah's latest mock draft for NFL.com has the Green Bay Packers getting help for the interior of the offensive line in the first round.
Jeremiah sent Alabama offensive lineman Landon Dickerson to the Packers at No.
29 overall.
From Jeremiah: "Dickerson is the best pure interior offensive linemen available.
I thought he might fall out of the first round after his ACL injury, but it appears his recovery is going smoothly.
He can step in following the departure of Corey Linsley."
Dickerson is Jeremiah's No.
40 overall prospect in the draft class, mostly due to injuries.
He suffered a torn...
The first episode of Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers hosting "Jeopardy!"
aired Monday.
The three-time MVP has nine more episodes airing over the next two weeks.
How did Rodgers do during his opening appearance?
It's time to go to the tape to evaluate the performance.
Here's a light-hearted breakdown of Rodgers' first episode as guest host (note: spoilers ahead):
– Solid intro.
Looks confident, ready for the moment.
Possibly too much swaying back and forth.
He might be fighting some nerves, and that's just fine.
– Terrific job reading the opening categories.
Noted the quotations, emphasized key or interesting words.

Brandon from Pleasant Prairie, WI
Is there something going on with "Jeopardy!"
this week…?
That's what I've been hearing.
I, for one, am looking forward to ﻿Aaron Rodgers﻿ standing behind the "Jeopardy!"
lectern over the next two weeks.
If Monday was any indication, this should be a lot of fun.
Eric from York, PA
Category: Game Show Guest Hosts.
Answer: To date this is the most comfortable and polished guest host of the hit show "Jeopardy!"
Question: Who is Aaron Rodgers?
What a polished performance.
I would expect nothing less from an amazing athlete and person.
He easily has a second career if he wants/needs one!
Outstanding.
I thought Rodgers did an outstanding job in his maiden voyage as "Jeopardy!"
guest host.
You could see him get more and more comfortable as the game progressed, showing his personality with how he acted out the clue for Larry David.
It was a very enjoyable half hour of television.
Todd from Loja, Ecuador
The ol' pigskin slinger acquitted himself quite well.
Did you get the final "Jeopardy!"
question?
I did!
I was quite surprised at how well I did.
Tristan from Durham, NC
As a regular "Jeopardy!"
watcher, I've rarely laughed so hard at a final answer.
Kudos to Rodgers for taking it with a sense of humor.
You could tell Rodgers wasn't expecting that but thought quickly on his feet and took it all in stride.
Rodgers was allegedly a little nervous before the show, but he's a natural.
I'm excited to watch him make the role his own over these next nine episodes.
Matthias from San Antonio, TX
Gentlemen, ﻿Marcedes Lewis﻿ is the lone blocking tight end in the roster we have, while Big Bob and ﻿Jace Sternberger﻿ are both natural move tight ends and ﻿Josiah Deguara﻿ is an H-Back and fullback more than in-line Y tight end.
I saw the Packers projected to pick Jordan, another physically talented move tight end from Miami.
Would I be off base to think that Tommy Tremble from Notre Dame, Hunter Long from BC and the 6-7 kid from Virginia would be more in line in seeking out a dual-purpose Y End?
Not at all…and I think the Packers do have their eye to the future in that regard.
They tried James Looney at tight end last year and already signed Bronson Kaufusi this offseason.
That Y position is so critical in Matt LaFleur's offense that it wouldn't surprise me at all if Green Bay went that direction in this year's draft.
You want these young guys to soak up as much information as possible while Lewis is here.

Jake from Athens, GA
Wes, do you share Mike's interest in a shifty slot receiver?
He has a point – without a Randall Cobb-type player, some concepts just aren't available to this offense.
On the other hand, as Curt was saying yesterday, LaFleur loves receivers who block, and true slot/gadget guys like Cobb and Tyler Ervin just don't have as much beef to block with.
To Cobb's credit, he was a better blocker than people gave him credit for being.
Spoff and I went back and forth on this last week and ultimately he changed my mind.
While it's been the Packers' wont to draft receivers 6-3 and above in height, there is something to be said for finding and developing a smaller, shifter receiver who not only can play the slot, but also help on jet-motion sweeps.
TK from Grafton, WI
What aspect of the NFL is most widely misunderstood by the fans?
My guess is the amount of time the coaches spend developing weekly game plans.
That's it – the meticulous detail that goes into developing game plans.
Coaches don't roll the ball out there and tell their guys to play.
Hours of planning go into every call.
Dean from Leavenworth, IN
I agree with Mike that positions of need in this year's draft are OL, DL, CB followed by ILB and WR.
The Packers have drafted one ILB in the top 125 (Oren Burks at No.
88) since A.J.
Hawk in the first round in 2006?
Although quality players can be found in any round, truly dominant superstars are found in the top rounds.
My question is if they could land a true superstar at ILB, what effect do you think that would have on their defense in today's NFL?
Are dominant ILBs overrated in today's game?
Thanks Wes.
Dominant inside linebackers are not overrated.
However, this idea your team can draft any inside linebacker with a fast 40 time and he's instantly an All-Pro is highly overrated.
Take Lavonte David and Devin White, for example.
They're both exceptional players but it's not easy for a team to find one, let alone two, ILBs of that caliber.
That's especially true in White's case.
It's like what Mike Tomlin told Chase Young last year – some coach had to lose a lot of games at some point to get a linebacker like Devin White on your team.
Why haven't the Packers drafted more inside linebackers?
Because it gets increasingly more difficult to find one late in the first round.
Barb from Marengo, IL
How many staff members do the Packers have to wade through all the college players?
It seems like a bigger job than in the past.
The Packers have 20 individuals listed in their personnel department, including Brian Gutekunst, but the coaching staff also lends a hand in studying prospects.
It takes a village to draft a player – not just a GM.
It's a culture Ron Wolf built, Ted Thompson sustained and now Gutekunst has carried on.
Brian from Mazzochetti, NY
Allen Lazard has shown consistency and an all-around game.
He blocks well, reliable hands, a large frame, has deceptive speed, and most importantly has AR's trust.
Although it seems like his ceiling has been reached, I think there's more to see.
He was really coming on in the Saints game last year, then battled an injury that really affected his season.
I look forward to seeing him continue to show how good a player he is.
I get what you're saying but got tripped on "it seems like his ceiling has been reached."
I beg to differ.
Lazard turned 25 in December.
He's entering just his third season in Green Bay.
In my estimation, there's still plenty of room to grow with his game.
Throw whatever qualifiers you want on Lazard and his game, but he makes this Packers' offense better.
You can win with that guy on the field.

Who was your favorite Packers draft pick before they played a down?
I loved this question and Spoff's response.
I just wanted to add in Aaron Rodgers.
I know, I know, I'm not exactly going out of the box there, but I've told the story before about being at UW-Whitewater when I heard about Rodgers' draft-day fall in 2005.
When Rodgers was still there at No.
24, I thought it a no-brainer for the Packers draft him.
The rest was history.
I've been wrong on plenty of players (e.g.
Jake Locker), but Green Bay taking Rodgers will forever be a meaningful memory for me.
Because I don't think the draft would play out like that in 2021 – not after a QB was discussed initially as a potential No.
1 overall pick.
Steven from Silver Spring, MD
In all three of the drafts he's run, Gute has traded up within the first round.
How does our draft capital measure up this year?
It's the most draft capital Gutekunst has had to work with since trading back in 2018 with the Saints.
With 10 picks, the Packers have more than enough picks to play the draft board as they see fit.
Sawyer from Simpsonville, SC
I've got a thought and a question.
In regard to Joel, could the Packers not being committal to Aaron Rodgers, and additionally, only be making moves as needed, to make space with an eye on the cap next year?
If you restructure Rodgers this year, it's gonna be harder to restructure that hit next year in a tight cap.
Also, could you imagine a Jaguars-Packers game in London?!
They're basically the UK Jaguars, so they've got that going for them, which is nice, I guess.
Correct.
The Packers and Rodgers would need to agree on an extension to lower his cap number for 2021 without inflating the cap number in '22 and '23.
To your question, Jacksonville blocked the Packers game from going overseas in 2016, so I don't see why 2024 would be any different.
My guess is the NFL will send the Packers to London in 2022 in that "extra" ninth home game spot.
Mike from Ames, IA
Being a Packers fan, I haven't paid too much attention to how international games have worked over the past while, but seeing all the talk about London in II confused me.
Is the game guaranteed for there or are other places that have hosted like Mexico City also an option?
I said this last week to a buddy of mine – the NFL hasn't waited this long to send the Packers anywhere other than London to play.
Green Bay is the only team that has yet to play in England.
That's the first domino that needs to fall for the Packers when it comes to the international series.
The sooner Green Bay plays an international regular-season game, the quicker the league can schedule the next one.
Guy from Telford, UK
I have been lucky enough to go to Lambeau to see the Packers.
Green Bay has to be the biggest attraction for an international game.
I think the next time I see them it will involve a lot less traveling.
Is there a bigger and better venue than Wembley for them to grace?
It's gotta be at Wembley, right?
I mean, Anthony Joshua didn't come to the United States to box Andy Ruiz in any old arena.
They wanted that fight at Madison Square Garden.
Bryce from Kenosha, WI
Regarding the suggestion of Fariborz from Flower Mount, TX, that the 17th game pit teams against each other 1-16 based on the previous year's record, wouldn't the concern be that, not only could you end up playing the same interconference team twice in one year (OK, I suppose), but also that both games could be at the same location?
Imagine being LA and having to travel to NY twice in one year.
I get having teams face an opponent from the other conference that finished in the same place in standings the previous year is the fairest way to do it.
I just find it very coincidental the league added a 17th game and immediately squeezed in a Rodgers-Mahomes matchup out of thin air.
George from Manchester, NJ
With the Packers having the top offense in football last year, why is the story still "they need to draft a receiver to complement ﻿Davante Adams﻿"?
The defense is where more help is needed with their first pick!
Granted with the losses on the O-line it needs to be attended to, but that can be done in later rounds.
I'm openly rooting for the Packers to draft a receiver – the earlier, the better.
Not even because I think the offense needs one – mostly so Spoff and I can stop answering the question.
Jeremiah from Columbia Falls, MT
Wes and Mike: What are your thoughts about all the low 40 times at the pro days?
Would it be advisable to take them with some suspicion?
Seems like they have some homer measuring devices.
It makes for good fodder in the media, but the reality is the Packers have boots on the ground at all these college pro days and are clocking prospects like they would in a normal year.
They're gathering all the information they need to get to make informed decisions later this month.
Derek from Eau Claire, WI
How many QBs do you think will be taken in the first five picks of the draft?
Three, especially after Carolina traded for Sam Darnold on Monday.
I just don't think there's going to be much urgency for teams to trade up to No.
4-5 with Atlanta and Cincinnati on the board and Miami sitting at No.
6 (all teams that don't need to draft a QB).
Dan from Edgerton, WI
Which NFC rival has done the most to improve in the offseason?
Minnesota.
The Vikings already took care of Dalvin Cook's contract last year, and signed Dalvin Tomlinson and Xavier Woods this past month.
Minnesota will again be formidable.
Craig from Brookfield, WI
Daily Double: Which NFL team would you say most desperately needs to find a decent starting QB?
And which NFL team would you say is most settled at the position with a top-notch starter and a good, reliable backup?
San Fran is the biggest contender with questions at quarterback entering the 2021 season, whereas the Packers and the Bills are the most settled in my mind.
Say what you want about Mitchell Trubisky but that's a good system for him in Buffalo.
He's the ideal backup to Josh Allen.
Vinny from Arlington, VA
Can you please explain the concept of voidable years in contracts and is this a new salary cap trick that's primarily been utilized this offseason due to the drop in the salary cap because of the pandemic?
Have the Packers used voidable years in prior years on contacts?
What are the long-term implications caused by adding voidable years?
Seems like it would provide immediate short-term cap relief but create a salary cap burden down in later years.
Thank you.
All it means is the bonus derived from the simple restructure is spread out past the expiration of the contract.
I don't recall the Packers previously using voidable years in contracts, but these are unprecedented times.
And they're not the only team doing it.
HAVE A QUESTION?
No one really knows what's going to happen until it happens
The complexion of an NFL schedule often looks vastly different come December
There's plenty of value in chemistry and continuity
It has to be a first, or very rare
There's no telling how it shakes out
It just means the game is the game
There's no reason to prioritize one position
Explosiveness and vision are what make Aaron Jones special
It's not easy making the cut
The D-Train isn't just a slogan.
The camaraderie is real.
Who are the best defensive players drafted over the last 30 years?

— Jeopardy!
(@Jeopardy) April 5, 2021
Aaron Rodgers’ first episode as the guest host of “Jeopardy!” included a playful jab at the Green Bay Packers by a contestant during the Final Jeopardy round.
Scott, the two-day champion, didn’t have an answer for the final clue, so he wrote down something he knew would get a reaction from Rodgers, the MVP quarterback who is hosting 10 episodes over the next two weeks.
“Who wanted to kick that field goal?”
The answer is, of course, in reference to Matt LaFleur’s decision to kick a field goal down eight points late in the fourth quarter against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the NFC Championship Game in January.
Instead of going for the touchdown with Rodgers on fourth down, the Packers took the three points but eventually lost by five.
Rodgers smiled and paused for a second or two before responding: “That is a great question.
Should be correct, but unfortunately for this game today, that’s incorrect.”
Rodgers told Rob Demovsky of ESPN that he could read what the contestants were writing during Final Jeopardy in real-time, adding even more hilarity to the moment.
Kudos to Scott for pouring salt into the wound.
After the loss in January, Rodgers said he wasn’t involved in the decision to kick the field goal.
It can be safely assumed he didn’t agree with the call.
To be fair to LaFleur, he didn’t have a great choice either way.
He either needed a touchdown on fourth down, the two-point conversion and a stop from his defense to force overtime, or the field goal, a stop from his defense and another scoring drive from the offense.
LaFleur took the second option, and the Packers ended up losing.
Rodgers’ stint as the “Jeopardy!” guest host is off to a knee-slapping start.

Free agent offensive lineman Lane Taylor visited his second team since the start of the new league year.
According to the league's transaction wire, Taylor – a starter for the Green Bay Packers to open the 2020 season – visited the Houston Texans on Monday.
Taylor visited the San Francisco 49ers last month.
Both teams likely want to check in on his recovery from the ACL injury he suffered in Week 1 of last year.
Taylor took a pay cut and returned to the Packers in 2020, and a strong summer earned him the starting job at right guard.
He was lost...
Daniel Jeremiah's latest mock draft for NFL.com has the Green Bay Packers getting help for the interior of the offensive line in the first round.
Jeremiah sent Alabama offensive lineman Landon Dickerson to the Packers at No.
29 overall.
From Jeremiah: "Dickerson is the best pure interior offensive linemen available.
I thought he might fall out of the first round after his ACL injury, but it appears his recovery is going smoothly.
He can step in following the departure of Corey Linsley."
Dickerson is Jeremiah's No.
40 overall prospect in the draft class, mostly due to injuries.
He suffered a torn...
The first episode of Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers hosting "Jeopardy!"
aired Monday.
The three-time MVP has nine more episodes airing over the next two weeks.
How did Rodgers do during his opening appearance?
It's time to go to the tape to evaluate the performance.
Here's a light-hearted breakdown of Rodgers' first episode as guest host (note: spoilers ahead):
– Solid intro.
Looks confident, ready for the moment.
Possibly too much swaying back and forth.
He might be fighting some nerves, and that's just fine.
– Terrific job reading the opening categories.

Packers.com consulted more than a dozen mock drafts from reputable national outlets and compiled a list of players most frequently mocked as draft selections in the bottom third of the first round (picks 20-32).
Between now and draft day, when the Packers are slated to select at No.
29 overall, those players will be profiled with thumbnail sketches in a new series entitled "Draft Digest."
Today's player is …
Eric Stokes, CB, Georgia
Height/Weight: 6-1, 185
Key stats: Intercepted four passes last season in 10 games to rank second in the Southeastern Conference, returning two for TDs.
College honors: Named first-team All-SEC by the media in 2020 after earning second-team honors the prior season.
Background: A Georgia native, Stokes learned the cornerback position early in his college career from Deandre Baker, a first-round draft pick in 2019.
After Baker's departure, he took over as a full-time starter, leading the team in '19 with nine pass breakups, but he had no interceptions.
He changed that in '20 with four, including a pair of pick-sixes, which boosted his draft stock.
He has tremendous speed, as the high school sprinting star clocked a pair of sub-4.3 40s at Georgia's pro day and posted a 38½-inch vertical.
He's criticized at times for grabbing with his hands too much in coverage, and like any player projected by some to go late in the first round, he's mentioned just as often as a second-rounder, but a high ceiling makes him an attractive prospect.
Potential fit with Packers: Green Bay is bringing back its top three cornerbacks from a year ago in ﻿Jaire Alexander﻿, ﻿Kevin King﻿ and ﻿Chandon Sullivan﻿, but looking to the future at this position and stocking it is a priority.
Stokes' blazing speed is reminiscent of former Packers corner Sam Shields, only Stokes will enter the NFL with far more experience as a cover man.
Stokes is seen as more of an outside corner than a slot one, and the impressive athletic ability and better-than-raw skills are certainly traits secondary coach Jerry Gray could work with, and they'd translate well to a special-teams role as punt gunner, too.

Aaron Rodgers didn’t take for granted his opportunity to host the legendary game show “Jeopardy!”
Instead of breaking down film of defenses, the Green Bay Packers quarterback went back to the tape to watch former host Alex Trebek, who passed away last year.
Rodgers told Rob Demovsky of ESPN that he studied for “hours and hours” and took “pages and pages” of notes to prepare for his two-week stint as a guest host of the show.
Rodgers’ 10 episodes, which were filmed in February, begin airing on Monday, April 5.
“I watched hours and hours and hours of episodes,” Rodgers told ESPN.
“Luckily Netflix has a few seasons, and I went back to DVR.
But I had to watch from a different perspective — from Alex’s perspective.
I couldn’t watch it as a fan anymore…I took pages and pages and pages of notes.
I wrote down every affirmative that he said to any type of clue.
I wrote down how he would respond if they didn’t get it right.
I wrote down beat points of the show.
I wrote down all the different ways he would take it to break.
I wrote down the stuff that he said coming out of break.
Literally, I studied for this like no other.
I wanted to absolutely just crush it.”
All the preparation must have paid off.
Even during the practice episode, Rodgers hit the ground running.
The 2020 NFL MVP, Rodgers is a long-time fan of the show and an admirer of Trebek’s work as a host.
He also won an episode of “Celebrity Jeopardy!” in 2015.
The game show has used several guest hosts since Trebek’s passing.
Rodgers is following Ken Jennings, Mike Richards, Katie Couric and Dr. Mehmet Oz.
His shows will air from April 5-16.
Anderson Cooper will follow.
Rodgers’ goal was to be as prepared as possible to step into Trebek’s shoes.
“..my whole thing was I felt like the best way to honor Alex’s memory was to be so dialed in and so ready, and that’s the approach I took,” Rodgers said, via ESPN.
“So I was ready to rock and roll.”

GREEN BAY – Swagger has been a popular buzz word inside the Packers' locker room this season, often used to describe the unquantifiable inertia powering the team's 13-win campaign.
It's a mindset and a lifestyle.
An unshakable confidence in one's ability to overcome regardless of the circumstances.
And when it comes to which member of Green Bay's roster personifies that ideal more than anyone, it's a fairly easy answer whenever players and coaches are surveyed for their opinion.
"Jaire always has it," defensive coordinator Mike Pettine responded.
"A guy who has the most swagger?
I'd probably say Ja'," defensive lineman ﻿Kenny Clark﻿ said.
"Jaire has his own little swag to him," added receiver ﻿Davante Adams﻿ recently.
"It's something I really appreciate."
Swagger and ﻿Jaire Alexander﻿ are synonymous with one another.
It's who he is and how he plays.
It's an attitude born out of not arrogance, but rather an indomitable confidence cultivated over years of proving the doubters wrong in his journey from a three-star recruit to one of the NFL's brightest young stars.
The flashy sunglasses and apparel offer a glimpse into Alexander's colorful personality, but the true measure of the man can be seen in how he's embraced life on an island, with no safety in sight, on most weekends during his breakout season.
More often than not, Alexander has stood mano-y-mano with the fastest and most explosive receiver the opposition has to offer, a high-wire act where one misstep could result in disaster for the defense and embarrassment for the young cornerback.
Yet, this is where Alexander feels most alive.
While having 20 cameras circled around him in a traditional locker-room setting isn't exactly Alexander's idea of a good time, he wants the spotlight on him whenever he's on the field.
He's welcomed that pressure since the Packers drafted him 18th overall out of Louisville in 2018.
His unparalleled self-confidence acted as the precursor for the shutdown cornerback Alexander has become over the past three years.
"I tell you guys all the time, he's been different since he came here, as far as his attention to detail.
Everything about him seems super vet-like to me," said Adams last month.
"He came in with this swag, this personality on the field that we hadn't really seen around here for a while."
That "swag" is justified.
Alexander has been one of the league's most difficult puzzles to solve in 2020.
According to Pro Football Focus, Alexander conceded just 35 catches (on 69 targets) for 337 yards and two touchdowns (with one interception) to opposing receivers in 2020.
His 0.64 yards allowed per snap were second fewest to only Los Angeles' Jalen Ramsey (0.53) among cornerbacks with at least 400 coverage snaps, while Alexander's 68.3 opponent passer rating was fourth lowest among cornerbacks.
And it hasn't come against nobodies, either.
Alexander has toed the line against Mike Evans, Adam Thielen, Justin Jefferson, Calvin Ridley, Allen Robinson, A.J.
Brown and Marvin Jones on his way to his first Pro Bowl nod and a spot on the AP All-Pro second team.
"Just to see all his hard work come to fruition on the field, I'm so happy for him," nickel cornerback ﻿Chandon Sullivan﻿ said.
"I feel like he should've been first team but that's another discussion.
He just raises the level in our room.
We see how well he's playing and it challenges us."
Pettine, in his third season as Green Bay's defensive coordinator, knows a thing or two about how a lockdown cornerback can change the complexion of a defense.
He had one of the game's best, Darrelle Revis, for four seasons with the New York Jets.
"Revis Island" was the Bermuda Triangle in Pettine's defense from 2009-12, erasing half the field for the opposing quarterback and leaving receivers disoriented.
Alexander is a different type of corner playing in a different era, but his level of play has enabled Pettine to be more flexible with how he utilizes safeties ﻿Adrian Amos﻿ and ﻿Darnell Savage﻿ on the back end, especially with Amos playing closer to the line of scrimmage to aid the run defense as of late.
"That's what's always nice about Jaire, where you know you always feel good about his area of the field," Pettine said.
"If I know one side of the field's locked down, you can take that safety and put him somewhere else and you maybe have a lurker in the middle of the field as opposed to a guy who has to sit on the deep half.
"So he's playing at a high level and it's great as a coordinator when you have that.
And the times that we haven't this year, I mean, it's definitely had an effect on our play."
Defensive backs coach Jerry Gray, a former four-time Pro Bowl cornerback in his own right, appreciates how the 23-year-old Alexander properly balances his confidence with understanding he's still not a finished product.
Coach and player worked ad nauseum this summer to round out Alexander's game, pushing the 5-foot-10, 196-pound corner past specializing in press-man coverage and learning how to integrate off-coverage into his game when the situation warrants it.
The expansion of Alexander's skillset contributed to him leading Green Bay in passes defensed (13) for the second straight year despite QBs targeting him 35 fewer times (104 in 2019 to 69), which can be a blessing a curse.
"The biggest thing you have to do is you have to fight against yourself of getting complacent," Gray said.
"That they won't try you, and then somebody will come up there and they'll try you.
So you have to be able to compete all the time within yourself, even when the ball is not coming your way.
'Hey, am I doing the right thing?
Am I on my receiver?
Am I being disciplined?'"
Alexander has maintained tunnel vision throughout.
In his most recent group interview on Christmas Eve, he talked openly about not being the tallest or biggest player on the field – but he has one superpower few others can match: swagger.
It's evident in his play style, in his candor and in his interactions with teammates (Alexander says he has a handshake with "everybody on the team").
Simply put, he's not afraid to show who he is and what he's about.
When asked about if he'd prefer to move around more, Alexander slips back in his chair and says with a wry smile, "I like having the island.
It's pretty cool.
Not too many visitors."
That's Jaire Alexander.
That's "J-Money."
And now is when that confidence matters most, with the Packers just one of eight remaining teams vying for the Lombardi Trophy.
In Alexander, the defense has its first All-Pro corner in nearly a decade (Charles Woodson, 2011) and it's going to be relying on him to help the Packers advance to their third NFC title game in five years with a win over the Los Angeles Rams on Saturday.
If Green Bay has learned anything the past three years, it's that the moment isn't going to be too big for its star cornerback.
"My swagger just comes from knowing myself, loving myself and having confidence," said Alexander last month.
"I think that's important, in order to have that swag is to have that confidence in yourself and being able to love yourself.
Not being afraid to shine a light."

Is it too early to get my hopes up that we will be able to watch training camp at Nitschke Field this year?
Didn't you hear?
The Packers are going to hold a training camp practice at every college football stadium in the state of Wisconsin this summer.
April Fools.
OK, got that out of the way.
James from Waynesboro, VA
Good morning Mike!
I read an article (by Rob Demovsky) that focused on our cap situation after next season.
I believe we are in good hands, but having eight players command 75%-plus of our salary cap is a bit nerve-wracking.
That sounds like cap hell for any team.
Does this put more pressure/focus on last year's and this year's draft class with what possibly appears to be a dramatic roster change on the horizon?
There's already pressure on last year's draft class to make strides in Year 2, as any team needs genuine improvement from within amongst its young players to remain a contender.
The same will be true a year from now with the upcoming draft class, no matter how many contribute as rookies.
But also, big picture, four of the eight names on that cap list you referenced will be entering the final year of their current contracts in 2022, which means they'll either be candidates for extensions, which would lower their '22 cap number, or for getting released with minimal dead money.
If a few players don't return, I wouldn't call that "dramatic roster change."
That's more like business as usual in the NFL.
Rich from De Pere, WI
The sixth thing we learned from Mark Murphy following the owners meeting is that the Packers have no interest in discussing Aaron Rodgers﻿' contract.
That might mean a lot … it might mean nothing?
But the answer sure fueled more questions and concerns from fans.
Any insight?
Sure.
I know the whole story but just can't tell you.
Another April Fools.
I'm done with those now.
Sorry, I've got nothing for you.
Wish I did.
In my 15 years here, the Packers have never discussed specific contract issues in the media, so Murphy's avoidance of the topic was expected.
So are the questions and concerns.
It's reached the point where speculation feels irresponsible without hearing from Rodgers himself, and when that'll happen I have no idea.
Bill from Eudora, KS
Good morning, Mike.
Now that the 17th game is official, one of the factors is that all 32 teams have to play an international game at least once every eight years.
How soon do you see the Packers making their first overseas game?
That's the million-dollar question, isn't it?
I asked Mark Murphy if the Packers (and by extension the NFC North) would be at or near the front of that eight-year international rotation because Green Bay hasn't played overseas yet, and he said he didn't know how the league would handle it.
I'm guessing the answer to my question is yes.
Take a look at photos of Green Bay Packers G/T Billy Turner from the 2020 season.

Mark Murphy mentioned the reduction to three preseason games creates a "bye week" in what would have been Week 4 of the old preseason format.
Does this mean that the season will end one week later than the old format?
Yes.
The regular season will now be 18 weeks (17 games plus a bye), but it still starts the week after Labor Day, and two weeks remain between the conference title games and Super Bowl.
Thomas from Cedar Rapids, IA
I put little stock in mock drafts but read for the entertainment and to satisfy my curiosity.
Some have no interior DL going until late in the first round.
If your need is both CB and DL and you can get the best DT but only the fourth-best cornerback does that enter into the equation, or is it all still overall value?
Getting the best value for the pick is paramount, but I don't think it's ever about the "best" this or "fourth-best" that because those rankings are only relative to one specific draft and don't say anything about how a player will compete at the NFL level, which is what scouting is all about.
In your scenario, all else being equal, how deep a team's draft board is at corner and D-line for subsequent rounds probably helps make the decision.
Jim from Cadott, WI
Do you think the 49ers wish they had a do-over in last year's draft when they trade up and took WR Brandon Aiyuk instead of QB ﻿Jordan Love﻿ now that they had to give up so much draft capital to move up and get a QB this year?
Jimmy Garoppolo had just led them to a Super Bowl.
They couldn't have foreseen his upcoming injury issues, and I don't believe they anticipated having doubts about him being their long-term answer just a year later.
Tyler from Cross Plains, WI
In terms of one single event defining a player's career, only one name comes to mind … Buckner.
Sure, except in that case it was totally unfair.
The guy hit .300-plus six times and drove in over 1,200 runs in his career.
If his worst moment doesn't happen with the (then) cursed Red Sox, it's also a slightly different story.
Reed from York, PA
Last year we traded up to draft the fourth overall QB, while only sacrificing a fourth-round pick.
Seeing what was given up for a crack at the second or third QB in this year's draft, by a team that has drafted a WR in the top 45 each of the past three seasons, I have to admire the wisdom of BG zigging while others zag.
Ask an Eagles fan how those early WR picks have turned out.
What single pick/draft move has impressed you most in BG's tenure?
I don't agree entirely with your premise (see comment on ranking players within a given draft above), but your point about WR picks is valid.
To answer your question, it has to be the trade with his very first pick in '18, to get an extra first-rounder the following year.
After all the trading over two years with those selections was done, Gutekunst turned a No.
14 overall pick plus a third-rounder and two fourths into the No.
18 and No.
21 overall picks in successive drafts, ﻿Jaire Alexander﻿ and ﻿Darnell Savage﻿.
That's not too shabby.
Michael from Burnsville, MN
What type of receiver do you think would be the best complement to ﻿Davante Adams﻿?
Adams seems like he does a little bit of everything, inside, outside, speed, jump balls, etc.
The draft seems like it has some smaller, fast, slot-type players and some slightly slower, but bigger jump and catch-radius types.
What would you pair with Davante?
I don't look at it as pairing someone with Davante as much as bringing a different dimension to LaFleur's offense as a whole, which I think would be the smaller, speedy type.
The question might be where in the draft the Packers would target such an addition.
If the next Randall Cobb is still there at the end of the second round, as the original article was a decade ago, I could see it.

Brian from Pensacola, FL
With the expanded schedule, is the 17th game going to be universally played in the final week, or will that matchup be sprinkled into the schedule "randomly."
The latter.
The final week of the regular season will still feature all division games, to my knowledge.
Mark from Providence, RI
With the expansion to 17 games this year, will the league consider adding another prime-time game teams can play?
Selfishly, from a work standpoint, I hope not.
Janet from Auburn, WA
I've only attended NFL games at Lambeau Field and in Seattle but have always wanted to experience Arrowhead Stadium.
This would obviously be a great year to attend to watch the Packers-Chiefs game.
Besides the great tailgating, what can you share about Arrowhead that a first-timer should experience if I'm lucky enough to visit sometime?
It's hard to describe, but Arrowhead – much like Lambeau – still has the charm of a bygone era yet there's little feeling anything "modern" is missing, at least from my experience.
And the finish to the national anthem there is pretty cool.
Tom from Palatine, IL
Is there a reason for the first year of the 17th game concept of AFC/NFC that they wouldn't keep it simple and just play East vs. East, North vs. North, etc.?
It just seems like it would be easier to start with and then just begin a rotation.
Just one man's opinion.
Welcome back, Mike.
The AFC North and NFC North are already matched up in the full-division rotation this year.
The Packers are playing the Ravens, Steelers, Browns and Bengals in 2021, so your way of starting the 17th game rotation would have created a duplicate AFC opponent.
Dale from Lima, NY
Just saw nfl.com's strength-of-schedule rankings for the 2021 season, revised to include the 17th game.
Da Bears have the third-hardest schedule.
The Packers fourth.
The Vikings fifth.
And the Lions are tied for the sixth-hardest schedule.
Ouch!
Looks like for this season the NFC North truly will be the black-and-blue division once again.
How often does an entire division clump together so tightly for this kind of ranking?
Well, the Bears, Vikings and Lions all have two games against a 13-3 team on their slates, so that's a huge factor in their rankings, while the Packers are playing a first-place schedule.
Also, the NFC North is playing all the teams in the AFC North (as mentioned) and NFC West, two divisions that produced a combined five playoff teams in 2020.

Dean from Leavenworth, IN
We don't know the when yet, but we now know the who and the where.
At first glance this would appear to be as challenging a schedule as any in recent memory.
Your thoughts at this point, Mike?
I don't ever recall 10 games against playoff teams from the prior year.
Granted, two of those are against a new No.
7 seed (Chicago), but still.
It's a gauntlet.
Most interesting to me is every non-division opponent coming to Lambeau (Browns, Steelers, Rams, Seahawks, Washington) went to the playoffs last year.
That has to be a first, or very rare.
Dalton from DeForest, WI
What international location would you be most excited or intrigued about as the site for the Packers' first international series game?
Definitely London, simply because there's such a strong contingent of Packers fans in the UK.
I want to see them bring it to Wembley or Tottenham.
Plus I'd like to visit one if not both of those stadiums someday, and a few of those crazy UK fans have promised to buy me a Boddingtons.
Dar from Mansfield, TX
Spoff, with Opening Day upon us and you being a baseballer turned Inboxer, I thought I'd inquire about your favorite sports fantasy.
Would you rather be in the opening-day lineup for an MLB team, starting on offense for the Packers vs. your childhood training-camp team, the Bears, about to hit your first tee shot at the Masters, or something else?
My youth fantasies were always about being on a major league ball diamond.
But at this stage of life, your Masters suggestion has strong appeal.
I don't play the game regularly anymore, but I did compete on my high school and college teams, the best part of which was getting to play tournaments on a lot of great courses around our state.
Roger from McGrath, AK
When we're on the clock during the draft I'm reminded of a question posed by an Alaska Board of Game member to a biologist who didn't have the data for the Board to make a decision that they couldn't duck.
"I know you don't know the answer but if you did, what would it be?"
The draft, as well and the II, is like that too, isn't it?
Hello to Rod in Chugiak.
That's the next quote getting pasted up in my cube.
Keith from Normal, IL
Good morning Mike, nice Seinfeld reference.
What episode would you say you enjoy the most?
Mine has to be the one where Elaine dances.
Hope you get to eat some Steak 'n Shake soon.
There is no favorite "Seinfeld" episode.
That's impossible for me.
And that's no April Fools.
Happy Opening Day.
HAVE A QUESTION?
It takes a village of scouts to draft a player
No one really knows what's going to happen until it happens
The complexion of an NFL schedule often looks vastly different come December
There's plenty of value in chemistry and continuity
There's no telling how it shakes out
It just means the game is the game
There's no reason to prioritize one position
Explosiveness and vision are what make Aaron Jones special
It's not easy making the cut
The D-Train isn't just a slogan.
The camaraderie is real.
Who are the best defensive players drafted over the last 30 years?

Brooks from Moore, OK
Mike, since there is a lot of angst about not signing an outside free agent, how about an April 1 column that lets the rumors fly?
I think we have to keep it rather straightforward with this crowd, or it just creates more work.
Bill from Janesville, WI
I see Peter King has projected that the NFC will be playing at the AFC this season for the 17th game.
Has the reasoning behind why the AFC is the home team in the first season been shared?
I would like to have seen the NFC home first based on the fact that the NFC won the Super Bowl this past season.
For all I know it was just a coin flip.
They had to start somewhere.
Wes from Warner Robins, GA
What are we doing about our secondary defense and WR?
I would suspect targeting certain players in the draft.
Tyler from Green Bay, WI
Wes's Sweet Sixteen wasn't as egregious as Bill Walton's Final Four.
Two teams from the same region and a total of five.
I'm sure that makes him feel better.
Richard from Madison, WI
Levi from St. Paul, MN, writes about "how happy I am that GB would never mortgage their future on a chance at a good QB."
Would you guess that Levi is probably too young to have encountered the name John Hadl, or is it that, given he's from Vikingland, nobody in his vicinity ever wants to bring up anything whatever that reminds them of Herschel Walker?
It's safe to say 1970s Packers management and 1980s Vikings management don't resemble how the teams operate today.
But speaking of draft trades for QBs, one thing I've always wondered about Wolf's 1992 trade for Favre is whether he had another plan to get him had he not been handed that extra first-rounder when he took over.
Wolf had the No.
5 and 17 overall picks in '92, the latter from a '91 draft-day trade by the previous regime with Philly.
I can't imagine he was going to give up a top-five pick for Favre.
He didn't need a Plan B so maybe he never devised one, but count me curious.
Matt from De Pere, WI
"Be sure to simultaneously provide the definition."
Well played, Mike.
Well played.
I didn't think that was too bad for the first day back.

John from Philadelphia, PA
I often use the Falcons' trade up for Julio Jones as a cautionary tale, not proof of concept.
I certainly believe the end result is more the exception than the rule, but those bold moves do work out on occasion.
John from Belleview, FL
I don't get all the accolades heaped on Julio Jones by everyone in the media.
He has caught 10 TDs or more in one of 10 seasons played.
﻿Davante Adams﻿ has caught 10 or more in four of seven seasons.
In 10 seasons Jones caught 60 TDs.
Adams has caught 66 in only seven seasons.
Catch percentage for Jones is 64.2% and for Adams is 64.8%.
So why is Jones worth so much more?
I don't get it.
C'mon, man.
Hey, I take nothing away from Adams, but if you're only going by TD catches, you're missing most of the story.
From 2014-19, Jones averaged 1,565 yards per season (more than Adams has ever had in a single year), led the league in receiving yards twice and receptions once, and was named All-Pro five times (two first-team, three second-team).
And despite the dearth in regular-season TDs, he has six in eight career playoff games.
I think Adams is on his way to a HOF career, but Jones is already there.
Jack from Racine, WI
Did Tim Boyle complete any regular-season passes as a member of the Packers during his career?
Yes, he was officially 3-of-4 for 15 yards in 2019.
He did not attempt any passes in 2020.
Ed from Minneapolis, MN
Do you think the Pack will have three QBs entering camp?
And do you think a "prove-it" vet, a draft pick, or a UFA is the most likely source?
I'd surmise a late-round draft choice or undrafted QB will be the No.
3 in camp.
Aaron from Scottsdale, AZ
Winning in the NFL is hard.
Even with a HOF QB, it is an oversimplification to say the team wins only because of said QB.
Football, among most sports, is the ultimate team game when it comes to W's and L's.
That said, GB has the third-best winning percentage in the league since 2000.
10 total teams have won a SB in the last 21 years with only five winning more than one: NE, Pitt, Balt, NY, and TB, and only NE winning more than two.
I think I'll trust the track record.
The answer is "sane expectations."
#"AllIn"Is4Suckers
I'm not going to relitigate the all-in nonsense again, and I'm not trying to troll the fan base or bring back recurring nightmares.
But I'd defy anyone to find another NFL team that has suffered more gut-wrenching postseason heartbreak this century than Green Bay.
In the McCarthy era alone, five times a playoff run ended with a "walk-off" loss, on the final play of the game.
Twice on the doorstep of the Super Bowl.
Last January's loss wasn't technically another walk-off defeat, but it was clearly a game that could have gone either way.
Winning only a single championship in that time doesn't mean the approach is wrong.
It just means the game is the game.
Jeff from Brooklyn, WI
Welcome back Mike, with the re-signing of ﻿Kevin King﻿ does Brian Gutekunst have more freedom to take BPA on either side of the ball, or does he still need to address the corner position?
I'm sure the future of the corner position is very much on his radar, and he will work the board to address it.
But with the top three back from last season, he can still target value and not be forced to reach.
James from Milwaukee, WI
While watching the 2011 season on Game Pass I was struck with this question: Has any other player ever had similar totals of tackles and sacks to go along with B.J.
Raji's running touchdown and pick-six?
If I recall, the Packers tried to complete a TD pass to Julius Peppers in 2014 but failed.
He would be the closest approximation off the top of my head.
Patrick from Gulf Breeze, FL
I think offensive line should be a priority come draft time.
That being said, ﻿Jon Runyan﻿ has shown he can be a quality piece if he keeps improving, but I'm really excited to see what a healthy ﻿Simon Stepaniak﻿ can bring to the table.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but he fell in the draft because of his injury correct?
Where would he have gone if healthy?
That's always a hard question to answer, and I did ask it of Stepaniak's position coach at Indiana when I talked to him last spring.
He couldn't say for sure, but he thought a round or two higher.
Mark from Sturgeon Bay, WI
Since GB is just under the cap, what would happen if they agreed to terms with a FA who would put them over the cap?
Can they sign the player but not submit to the league until they make the necessary cap adjustments?
If not, would a player agree to "hold" on the contract for a predetermined amount of time so the team can make the adjustment(s) needed?
Good relationships can foster helpful agreements, but having all the ducks in a row and putting everything into place very quickly would be required.
Barry from De Pere, WI
Re: the all-time Packers-who-share-their-last-name-with-a-president list, besides Washington, let's give some love to Mike Arthur, Len Ford, Roger Harding, Anthony Harrison, four named Hayes, Henry Monroe, and seven (!)
Wilsons.
(Yeah, I was bored enough to look).
I figured someone would be.
James from Santa Maria, CA
Regarding best Packers players with presidential names, a replacement player from the strike season was mentioned, so my question is have any players continued in the league after being a replacement player and if yes, who were the best?
Any HOF player?
No, but Oilers LB Eugene Seale stuck around from the '87 strike until '92 and was a Pro Football Weekly All-Pro selection on special teams in '88.
The best replacement player story, though, belongs to Sean Payton.
He played QB for the Chicago "Spare Bears" in '87, attempting 23 passes.
He had almost as many sacks (seven) as completions (eight), and he threw one interception.
Against the Saints.
David from Ringwood, NY
I enjoy "Packers Unscripted" very much.
Have you decided to no longer do the podcast?
Thanks for listening.
We'll be starting up again sometime in April, prior to the draft.
We just haven't finalized the re-launch date.
Douglas from Bloomington, IL
I keep hearing draft prospects as having good "twitch."
How would you define twitch?
Instantaneous reactions that translate into mini bursts of energy?
Corey from Richland, WA
Mike, going into this offseason how much did you think the roster would resemble what it does today with losing only two significant players in Corey Linsley and Jamaal Williams?
I expected the cap circumstances to force the loss of a starter or two on defense.
Doug from Neenah, WI
Good morning, Mike.
Have you ever written about the similarities between NCAA basketball bracketology and NFL mock drafts?
No matter how much time and effort you put into researching the endless possibilities, after the first day you're huddled around the dumpster fire just hoping to enjoy the rest of the process.
Welcome back!
I read that you have better odds of hitting four holes-in-one in a single round of golf than picking a perfect NCAA bracket.
I would rank a perfect first round mock draft slightly easier than both.
More like three aces in one round.
Al from Green Bay, WI
The Packers are disadvantaged on draft day in that they will be picking near the end of every round.
However, the compensatory picks help to level the playing field.
Would you rather have the Packers' current draft position plus the three compensatory picks or only the natural seven picks, but selecting in the middle of each round?
My instinct said the latter, and the draft chart proved me right.
The chart says the Packers' current 10-pick draft capital is worth 1,175 points.
The 15th pick in each of the seven rounds would be worth a total of 1,766.
It's not close, really.
It simply comes down to having two picks in the top 50 immensely increases the odds of acquiring a premier player.
Jeff from Milwaukee, WI
What's the most impactful move the Packers have made so far in the offseason?
There's no question it's re-signing ﻿Aaron Jones﻿.
Losing him would have made it much, much harder than it already will be for the league's top offense to stay there.
Joe from Swansea, IL
Which player made you feel the biggest when standing next to them?
Morgan Burnett.
One time at a liquor store I was shopping for beer (naturally) and spotted him in the wine section.
He looked almost lost, and when we made eye contact he said, "I'm in trouble with the wife."
We both laughed.
Congrats to a great guy on a great career.

Hey Mike, welcome back.
Please pass onto Rod from Chugiak the next time he is in Lincoln City to look for Packers helmets in treetops.
My boys each put one up in two different trees and I gave a power company guy a pack of smoked salmon to put a third one up while he was trimming branches from a bucket truck.
What's the wildest thing a neighbor of yours has done to show he bleeds green and gold?
When you live in the heart of Packer Nation, nothing ever comes across as too wild.
Your loyalty is not to be questioned, but your wisdom in parting with smoked salmon might be.
Though I suppose out there that's the equivalent of me giving someone here a package of brats.
Jake from Athens, GA
Good to have you back, Mike.
And thank you for posting Rod from Chugiak's submission.
Matching, monogrammed T-shirts should be just enough to finally push us all over the precipice of fandom into the beautiful abyss of culthood.
However, once we make that leap, you're going to have to cut out the "I don't get too hung up on it either way" business.
There's no place for that kind of even-headedness where we're going.
Duly noted.
Larry from Carney, MI
Can a person's legacy be determined in a single event or is it always much more?
What is your legacy?
Has your event happened yet that defines your legacy?
Well, I heard some people talkin' just the other day, and they said you were gonna put me on a shelf.
But let me tell you I got some news for you, and you'll soon find out it's true, and then you'll have to eat your lunch all by yourself.
Eddie from La Crosse, WI
Many happy returns!
Spring is here again, the Suez Canal is back in business, and Mike Spofford is rested and reloaded.
He's ready to lay waste to any and all armchair general managers who didn't learn the first time.
Life is good.
:-)
And Opening Day is only 48 hours away.
Happy Tuesday.

Hey everybody.
Thanks for logging on today.
Hope all is well.
I see there are some questions already in so I'll get started.
Keep asking away and I'll do my best.
Hey Mike, hope you are doing well.
What do you make of the news this morning that the 49ers have shut down their facility due to a positive COVID-19 test?
Well, that news just broke not long ago so the league will be going through the contact tracing protocols and everything else.
I honestly don't know what will happen now.
The Packers are scheduled to fly out there late this afternoon, with the plane leaving in about 5 hours.
We'll just have to see what the league says.
When the schedule first came out this game looked like a likely L. Now an L would feel like a real loss to a team playing a 2nd string QB and without its all-world TE.
This is a game the Packers have to win.
The 49ers are so banged up.
Green Bay has its own injury issues and COVID-related absences as well, but nothing on the scale of what the 49ers have dealt with all season.
San Francisco proved its still plenty tough the last few weeks, with two big wins and a good fight in Seattle.
It won't be easy, but the Packers have to take advantage of what's in front of them and win this game.
With players on both teams testing positive for COVID-19, and so close to kickoff, do you think there's a chance this game gets postponed?
At this point, it can't be ruled out.
The Packers' tests have all been clear since the lone positive, but with a 49ers positive the day before the game I'm not sure how the league will want to handle that.
Switch ﻿Rashan Gary﻿ to Rover?
His awesome pursuit might help the run game and let's ﻿Za'Darius Smith﻿ focus on the pass rush from the edge.
I don't anticipate any major scheme or alignment changes up front at this point, though I've been wrong before.
The Packers didn't play well up front and paid for it, but as a unit they've shown they can be much better than that and have to find that level of play consistently.
Hey Mike!
This doesn't necessarily have much to do with the Packers upcoming game but I'm interested in your answer.
What advice would you give to aspiring young reporters/writers?
I don't have enough space here to really say.
In a nutshell, I'd say learn how to conduct a good interview and tell someone's story before you start worrying about crafting your own opinions.
Do you expect to see more ﻿Dexter Williams﻿ as our primary RB with ﻿Tyler Ervin﻿ getting more involved with jet sweeps, or more of a split carries backfield between the two?
It's really hard to say, but I would think the Packers would still want to utilize Ervin on the sweep motions.
Dexter Williams could have a huge opportunity in front of him, getting thrown into a major role like this.
It's always interesting to see how a player responds to this situation.
He got on the field on special teams in Houston and made a costly mistake, so I would imagine that only adds to his motivation to prove he belongs out there.
I think it will be very hard to resign ﻿Kevin King﻿ after the year.
He simply isn't on the field enough.
I know the defense is much better with him than without, but I'm guessing the cost could be $10M per and it just seems he can't be counted on to be on the field.
How do you see it?
King's injury history, which unfortunately has resumed this year after a strong and healthy 2019, makes his market very difficult to predict.
If he had put together another healthy and productive season like last year, I'd have expected a really big price tag.
Now, who knows?
Maybe he comes back quickly and the rest of the season there are no issues.
But no guarantees there obviously.
There could be a wide variance in what teams, including the Packers, think he's worth.
How is ﻿Mason Crosby﻿ doing?
Is he off the injury list?
He is still on the injury report but there's been no indication he's in any worse shape than last week, when he was available for place kicks, but gave way to ﻿JK Scott﻿ on kickoffs.
What is the latest time someone like ﻿Allen Lazard﻿ can come off of IR and still be eligible to play tomorrow?
The Packers have until 3 p.m. CT tomorrow to make roster moves for a Thursday night game.
I don't know what moves the Packers are going to make, but I'm expecting at least a few.
I know SF is really banged up on offense, but how's the secondary looking?
Given the Packers RB situation, I wouldn't be surprised if Lafleur and ﻿Aaron Rodgers﻿ opt for pass heavy play calling.
Other than Richard Sherman's injury, the 49ers' secondary is pretty much the same unit as last January.
The DBs plus Warner and Greenlaw at linebacker.
The rest of their defense looks very different.
I think a lot of this game will fall on Rodgers due to the Packers' RB situation, but they'll still need a ground game of some kind to keep SF honest.
Ted Ginn Jr. would look great in our slot, Bears just released him, what do you think?
The Bears are having a lot more trouble on offense than the Packers do, so if Ginn can't help them, I'm not sure how much he could help GB.
But in a year like this I guess there's no reason to rule anything out.
Is it just me or have the Packers been unable to stop the run for years now.
When was the last time they finished in the Top 10 in run defense?
It's been a while, and I'd have to halt the chat to look it up and be sure of my info.
But they don't have to be top 10 against the run, they just can't have these games like last January and last week when the other team's run game completely dominates.
They have to play more consistently and figure out how to stem the tide in a game when things start to go wrong.
Do you think ﻿Darnell Savage﻿ has reached the expectations so far in year 2?
I think the Packers were looking for more of a Year 2 jump from him in terms of high-impact plays.
That hasn't happened yet, but there's still a lot of season left.
What is the biggest difference, outside of COVID, between the 2019 Packers and the 2020 Packers?
My opinion is the number of injuries to overcome.
No question.
The Packers were remarkably healthy all last season.
They've had a lot more to deal with this year, and so far they've managed to navigate them pretty well.
The offense needs ﻿David Bakhtiari﻿, ﻿Aaron Jones﻿ and Lazard back sooner than later, though.
Those are three key players on one side of the ball and we saw last week how hard it is to consistently produce on offense without them.
Can you help me understand why players having been in contact with positive cases are being automatically ruled out despite being tested every day...?
Because exposure doesn't necessarily lead to a positive test right away.
The virus can be incubating for a few days and then show up as a positive test, but the infected person could be spreading it to others in the meantime without knowing.
It's the high side of caution, but with the way these outbreaks have gone, a string of positive tests can show up within a team over the course of several days.
No one knows the extent all at once, so the goal is to isolate high-risk contacts as soon as possible for five days even if they're testing negative.
I think all Packer fans are worried that next year we won't be able to sign all the players on our roster that we'd like to keep.
I expect we'll lose a few of our favorites.
But isn't every team in that situation?
Does it mean the market will be flooded with free agents of all types and positions?
With the expected drop in salary cap for 2021, nothing about this next offseason and free-agency season is going to be normal.
It's going to be uncomfortable for a lot of teams and very unpredictable.
Another big difference between the Packers in 2020 vs 2019 is this year's lack of forced turnovers by the defense.
Absolutely.
If you had told me before the season started the Packers would have four takeaways through seven games, I'd doubt the team would be 5-2.
Those types of plays were huge last year, and they have to get back to those.
They're generated mostly by pressuring QBs, and you have to stop the run to force teams to throw.
Even when the Packers have done that, the pass rush has been lacking at times.
Is there any chance that we see ﻿John Lovett﻿ getting carries out of the backfield (with his background as a fullback)?
Who knows at this point, but he's been spending his time in practice and meetings with the tight ends, not the running backs.
Same with Ervin being with the receivers and not the backs.
That's why I think Dexter Williams will be a key player in this game.
There has been speculation that one way to improve the run defense with existing personnel is to play closer/tighter coverages and force the opposing QB's to make throws.
How is Mullens as a deep ball passer?
I don't know enough about him, frankly, but he was moving their offense just fine last week in Seattle after he came off the bench.
The Seahawks' defense isn't what it's been in the past, but still, he was productive.
I think the best way to fix the run D is through gaps control.
Everyone has to beat their man and fill in gap.
Packers aren't lacking talents, they just need to do their jobs.
Execution is everything.
No question, and when they get a chance at a tackle in the backfield, they have to make it, or at least slow up the ball carrier enough for other guys to arrive.
Tackling doesn't have to be perfect, but complete whiffs don't allow for any help to get there.
What is your opinion on the failed Will Fuller trade?
I said what I thought in Inbox this morning, that I wasn't surprised at all.
I think Fuller could have helped the Packers, yes.
But I'm sure the Texans were asking for at least a second-round pick, figuring they'd get a third-rounder as a comp pick if he leaves in free agency after the season.
And the cap was the bigger concern.
He'd have been an expensive half-year rental eating up potential carry-over cap space the Packers will probably need to make competitive offers to Bakhtiari and/or Jones.
Follow up on the extensions / 2021 salary cap: Often new contracts of top players reset the market.
Average salaries always rise.
Could it be different next year?
Lower valued and shorter contracts?
I think the market will have to change considerably, but it's hard to say how much it changes for the truly elite players, or if the financial adjustments are more with mid-level players getting contracts restructured and lower offers in free agency.
It's really hard to predict.
Wasn't there rumblings that next year's cap might not go down, instead borrowing from future cap increases?
It's going down, but the total amount of the cap decrease is being spread out over multiple years, not just next year.
If it were all next year, you'd have chaos with such a major drop.
It's going to be chaotic enough in some senses.
In both the II and other forums the discussion of talent has come up for our roster on defense.
While it is true that many players had good seasons last year, that doesn't actually prove they can do it every year.
The ability to reproduce that level of physical effort for 20 games for consecutive seasons isn't a given.
No, it's not.
The game is played by humans.
The Packers had a couple of guys who put up career years in 2019.
They had others they were projecting to make big strides.
It doesn't always work out.
But I'm not defining anyone's season after seven games.
The Packers have who they have and there are plenty of guys who know they need to do more.
When will they likely decide on the game being played tomorrow?
I would think the league would have to decide by late this afternoon, before the Packers get on the plane, if the game is on as scheduled or needs to be postponed.
Hi Mike - Which matchups do you think are most important for the Packers to win against SF?
Which ones are you most optimistic about?
I think the Packers should be able to protect Rodgers better from the 49ers' pass rush than they did in the two games last season because SF has lost multiple dynamic players up front.
I also think the defense should be able to better avoid giving up the explosive plays that burned them in these matchups last year.
So protection and big plays allowed are where the Packers can change the results.
When would a postponed game be likely made up?
I'm sure the league's preferred option would be to still get the game in this weekend because the Packers have already taken their bye.
The league would prefer to put off adding a Week 18 for makeup games at the end of the regular season for as long as possible.
Hi Mike, care to share which players on the defense you expect to have a breakthrough day tomorrow?
It could be any number of guys.
Other than the final play of the Houston game, the defense has not generated a turnover since Week 3, I believe.
There is a morbid fascination with this game of attrition.
We are missing AJ's but they are missing Kittle.
Who can be weighed down the least?
It's not just those guys.
The Packers have a ton of guys on the injury report while the 49ers have a ton of guys on IR.
Are the Packers getting anyone back soon, like Bakhtiari, Lazard or King?
We may not know until tomorrow.
With all the injuries it might be advantageous to wait until Sunday to play?
That could benefit the Packers with some of those guys I mentioned.
It would also possibly allow ﻿Jamaal Williams﻿ and ﻿Kamal Martin﻿ to clear the five-day high-risk window if they don't have any positive tests.
They'd be eligible to play on Sunday.
But again, I don't know where the league is on the current situation with SF's positive test.
Do you think penalties could become a problem again in the game tomorrow, or is it more of a discipline thing that will probably be solved?
(Thank you so much for your great work, Mike!)
Penalties hadn't been a problem for the Packers until last week, when they had one of the league's flag-happy crews.
But that's not an excuse.
If you know the data on a crew you have to play more disciplined, and the Packers didn't do that.
But that was the first time this team was hit with a bunch of flags in one game, so I think it's a good bet they'll play cleaner moving forward.
I thought I read the Packers / 49ers game could be moved back as far as next week Tuesday if needed.
Is that not correct?
There was a game played on a Tuesday night already this year, so there's precedent, yeah.
All right, folks, I have to sign off.
Thanks for the participation as always and I guess we'll see what we learn the rest of today.
One way or another, hope to chat again next week.
Take care, Mike

packers.com senior writer
Hey everybody.
Thanks for logging on today.
Looks like there are questions coming in already so I'll get started.
Ask away ...
Good mourning Mike.
What a stiff-arm.
Been watching football for 60 years and I'm not sure I've seen one better.
Did you see it last night and what were your thoughts?
That was something.
Derrick Henry is a strong dude.
Forces of momentum play a factor in a situation like that, but it'll be on a highlight reel for a long time, that's for sure.
Hi Mike!
Thank God the bye week is over.
I know how important the bye week is for the players, however I hate the fact that I don't get to watch my favorite team play.
Personally, I don't like how early bye weeks begin.
Why not have just a four week window for bye weeks instead of weeks 5-11?
I feel like it would be much more fair.
The league likes to keep as large a slate of games as possible each week, so the byes are spread out.
It's the way they've always done it and I don't see that changing.
Do you think Bruce gave Tom B a thorough tongue lashing after their last game?
Not at all.
He screwed up and he knew it.
I thought making light of himself with the social media meme was pretty funny.
It's just that Brady never seems to afford his teammates the same latitude in the heat of the moment.
Hi Mike.
Are you of the opinion that our defensive line / defense is getting better and good enough to make a run should we go to playoffs?
I do think the defense is getting better, but there will be plenty of challenges along the way.
It's a process for both sides of the ball to get to where they're going to be come December and January, which is when it really counts.
The offense is flying high, but it's going to face some adversity and have to respond as well.
﻿Davante Adams﻿'s and ﻿Kenny Clark﻿'s status?
I would think they're in good shape for this week but I can't say for sure.
We'll see what their official statuses are at the end of the week.
Who's going to be featured this week for the offense?
Tampa Bay has a pretty stout run D, though losing Vita Vea could change that a little.
I think this one comes down to ﻿Aaron Rodgers﻿ and Adams doing their thing, with getting just enough from the running game against a tough front.
Mike, being a Packers fan from Massachusetts I've seen my fair share of Brady games.
While he's great, no doubt, a common theme to those games is capitalizing on the other teams' mistakes.
A blocked punt, a pass interference, a turnover, etc.
Protecting the ball and playing mentally sound football is key.
Serenity now.. serenity now...
Absolutely.
Playing clean football is how you limit Tom Brady's opportunities, and you have to capitalize on any mistakes he makes.
He's thrown two pick-sixes this year.
He didn't overcome the first one, but he was able to rally back from the second one.
Thanks for doing this.
I have been watching our WR's block pretty well.
Do you think that Gutie keeps that in mind when drafting WR's?
It's part of the picture, but I don't think it's an overriding concern.
Blocking can be taught.
What they look for on college film is the willingness to use their bodies physically.
Position coaches can help refine technique.
Hey Mike.
As you and Wes have eluded to in your stories and in II, you really have to like the depth this team has.
Clark goes out, ﻿Kingsley Keke﻿ and ﻿Tyler Lancaster﻿ step-up.
﻿Christian Kirksey﻿ goes down, ﻿Ty Summers﻿/﻿Krys Barnes﻿ step-up and ﻿Kamal Martin﻿ is still on deck.
OL kept moving guys around and Rodgers has stayed mostly clean.
WR's go down and the offense doesn't even blink an eye...
I like our chances going forward with this in mind.
So far the depth has been up to the challenge, and all those extra snaps the young players have received should pay dividends down the road.
But the Packers are going to want their top guys back, make no mistake about it.
Adams and Clark and crucial for this team to go as far as it wants to.
Hey Mike, could this finally be the week ﻿Tyler Ervin﻿ gets the ball on an end around play?
He's currently dealing with a wrist injury and didn't practice Monday, so we'll see.
Mike...First...a quick "thank you" to both yourself and Wes for all your hard work-ESPECIALLY given the circumstances.
Are you "surprised" at how prolific GB's offense has been the first four weeks without the benefit of any on-field training camp, pre-season games, etc.
?
I am and I'm not, if that makes sense.
The limited training camp following no offseason was not ideal, but defenses were dealing with the same limitations.
Also, no fans at Minnesota and at New Orleans worked to GB's advantage.
I figured the offense would find another level in Year 2 with LaFleur and Rodgers together, but I didn't think it would be this quickly.
Then again, some of the circumstances have helped more than hurt.
With Vita Vea absence do the Packers have a chance to exploit the middle of the Bucs D?
I would think the Packers would probe there and see how the Bucs react.
Mike, from your observations, what sorts of things do you expect to see Packers looking to improve on coming out of the bye week?
As I mentioned on our latest Unscripted episode, I think it's short-yardage situations on offense, and tackling and takeaways on defense.
The Packers can be better in short yardage and they know it.
Defensively, the tackling started fine the first two games but has slipped the last two, and three takeaways in four games isn't enough.
Is there a scenario both Kamal Martin and Krys Barnes are on the field at the same time?
Sure, but I don't know if it'll be this week.
Martin missed the tail end of training camp and then a whole month.
I don't anticipate him being thrown into a big role on gameday right away, if he's even active for this Sunday, which is not a given by any means.
Which team in the NFC concerns you the most Mike?
Love all of the work yourself and Wes do everyday, I'm a big fan!
Thank you!
It's hard not to be impressed with Seattle being 5-0.
They were an eyelash away from losing two games, to the Patriots and Vikings, but they've continued to win despite a defense allowing the most yards in the league (which is hard to believe given the history of that team).
I expect Seattle's defense to improve as the season goes along, and Wilson is lighting it up, just like Rodgers is.
It's too early to say it's a two-team race in the NFC, because the Rams and Bears only have one loss apiece, and no way I'm writing off the Saints or Bucs yet.
But teams like Tampa, SF, NO can't afford to lose too many more early to have a shot at the 1 seed and only bye.
Are the Seahawks the best team in the NFC?
Are they the one to beat in order to get to the Super Bowl?
Maybe.
The Seahawks and Rams still have to play twice, so those games will go a long way in positioning.
Same with the Packers and Bears.
There's a lot to be decided yet.
Haven't seen much from practice reports, but do you think ﻿Equanimeous St. Brown﻿ will be ready to step in at WR on Sunday?
I put him in the same category as Martin.
He's missed a lot of time.
I think to expect a player to just jump into practice for a few days and play a bunch of snaps in a game right away isn't realistic, or safe for the player, frankly.
How much does ﻿Jaire Alexander﻿ practice his ball catching and tracking skills I feel he's on the verge of all-pro status and just needs to finish more picks.
Noticed in the past many times he's in great position but the hands and ball don't quite match at the moment of the catch.
Those skills are developed over thousands of repetition's.
Alexander has the hands.
That's not the issue.
He's admitted himself he has to catch the ball first when he has the opportunity before looking to run.
He just mentally gets ahead of himself.
It'll come.
Some in the Chicago media think the Bears DC had his best game against the Bucs.
How could Mike Pettine use this on Sunday?
I take nothing away from Chicago's defensive effort, but any DC looks good when he can get pressure without blitzing and flood the coverage lanes against a good QB.
Brady is not going to scramble around.
If the four-man rush can get there, seven in coverage makes it tough.
The Packers have to make sure they tackle Ronald Jones, though.
He's a tough guy to bring down, and the Bucs will feed him and let him use his spin move regularly.
What do you think about the Vikings going for it on 4th and inches with the opportunity of kicking the field goal and eventually extending the lead?
I liked the call.
I realize they could have gone up 8 and been playing OT worst-case scenario, but the chance to put the game away without giving the ball back to Wilson I thought was their best shot.
It didn't work out.
Give Seattle credit.
The Vikes were running the ball at them that whole drive but couldn't get the few inches they needed when it mattered most.
Pack looks great, but this next four game stretch is tough.
When offense gets to 1-yard line, they need to score.
Didn't cost them vs.
Falcons, but do you think they are practicing those short yardage situations to get better?
LaFleur blamed himself for the bad call vs. Atlanta.
The short-yardage failures vs. Minnesota and New Orleans looked more like execution, and the players have seen the film.
Hi Mike, I see that Kamal Martin and St. Brown are both back at practice.
Do we know the status on ﻿Rashan Gary﻿?
Gary was back at practice on Monday, so that's a good sign.
How do you see ﻿Raven Greene﻿'s role as we proceed past the bye?
It seems he's earned more snaps.
Pettine was pleased with what Greene gave him in the Atlanta game.
He's the perfect fit for that hybrid role on the second level and I think Pettine wants to use him there a lot.
How do you think the Playoffs will be impacted with majority of stadiums not having fans?
Seems like the key is the first-round bye but the home field advantage for dome teams are gone.
GB still has the advantage of playing in the cold.
Yeah, unless the fan situations drastically change, the playoffs will be more about the weather than the home field itself.
NFL Network has the Packers rated #1 in their latest power ranking.
Is this too high?
Those rankings are fun and all, but they mean absolutely nothing.
It doesn't matter how a team is playing now.
It matters how a team is playing 2 months from now, and that's a long way off.
Whose absence hurts their team's run defense more: Kenny Clark or Vita Vea?
Perhaps we'll find out.
The Packers certainly missed Clark, but the run defense looked a lot stronger vs. Atlanta when Clark missed his third straight game.
It can take time.
The Bucs will be making their first adjustment without Vea.
Sometimes that's when it's toughest.
Aaron Rodgers has been great for the Packers for so many years.
But, am I alone in thinking there is just something different about him this year?
He looks like a man on a mission and I don't know if anything can slow him down.
He's playing at an MVP level, no doubt about it.
He's given us some insight into it, though without a lot of specifics, about spending time in the offseason to get to a better place mentally and watching his own old film to look for things.
But he's said many times he's found a comfort in this offense, which he didn't have last year when he was trying to learn it all.
That's really the biggest thing.
Besides the obvious one which games are you most interested in this week?
Bears-Panthers and Rams-49ers.
Carolina is a quiet 3-2 and will be a tough game for Chicago.
The Rams look strong and could hand the 49ers a fourth loss already.
That would be significant.
Tom Brady was a week early in forgetting what down it was.
I would gladly have had him forget on Sunday about it being 4th down instead of last Thursday night.
Ha, he's not going to make that mistake again.
As I said in Inbox last week, I think that was the first time we've seen the lack of crowd noise work against the road team.
There's no way he doesn't know it's fourth-down if he's coming up to the line of scrimmage and a Soldier Field crowd is in full-throat with the game on the line.
Any ﻿David Bakhtiari﻿ contract talks swirling around lately?
At all?
Haven't heard anything.
Bakhtiari is speaking with the media today but he's made it pretty clear he's not going to keep talking about it.
Hi Mike!
Thanks for doing this.
Do you think ﻿Robert Tonyan﻿ will have a significantly reduced role now that Davante is back?
I know we can't really expect another 3 TD game from him, but I was so impressed with how he fought for those catches and TD's, and really hope he continues to be a big part of the receiving game.
Tonyan is the No.
1 tight end on this team as far as I'm concerned.
That's not a knock against Marcedes Lewis, who is the veteran leader of the group, but Lewis does not have the passing game role Tonyan does.
Yes, Adams is coming back and will get a lot of attention, but Tonyan was targeted only six times vs. Atlanta in having that huge game.
He can still get six targets a game, easily.
Do you find it hard to not get excited over the Pack's fast offensive start or does your sportswriter professionalism prevent it?
I just know it's a long season.
Only five years ago, the Packers were 6-0 heading into a bye week.
Then they came out of the bye and lost 3 straight, not looking anything like the team we'd seen.
I'm not saying that's going to happen to this team, which I think is much better and deeper than the '15 team.
But anything goes in this league.
It's tough to keep winning the way the Packers have.
I'm trying to not get my hopes up and just enjoy the journey.
That said, what is one reason we should be excited for this team's chance at reaching it's ultimate goal, and what is one road bump that has a high-level possibility of derailing them?
The reason for excitement is the injuries to this point haven't knocked the team off course, and some of them have been to significant players.
That's a sign you have a strong roster for the long haul.
The possible bump?
It's the NFL, and you can't take anything for granted.
Mike McCarthy said once a team has to learn how to handle winning.
Do you see this as a potential problem this year?
No.
While I agree with McCarthy's point, this team learned how to win last year.
Lots of close, down-to-the-wire games, and they found ways.
Are you bummed or relieved to not have to travel to Tampa this week?
Has it been a nice change of pace to stay local while the team is away?
I miss being at the games themselves, that's for sure.
But I don't miss the travel, hotel, time away from my family, and all of that.
I also don't miss writing stories on bus and plane rides after the game.
But not being there for the actual game is a huge adjustment.
I saw on the Dope sheet that the Packers average more than 10 yards per third down, but their opponents average 4.2.
How significant is that?
It's called the money down for a reason.
The Packers have converted several third-and-longs already this season.
I'm not sure that's sustainable, but they've been tough to stop no matter the down and distance.
What are the chances MLF will try to get ﻿AJ Dillon﻿ on the field more?
Jones and Williams are playing lights out, so (injuries aside) it seems crazy to shake things up.
What a great problem to have!
I think that's the way LaFleur sees it.
He wants to get Dillon involved more, but forcing it and potentially breaking the rhythm of the offense when it's going so well is a risk.
It's a long season, though, as I keep saying.
In response to an II response, is there anything to be said for Jaire not getting interceptions because he's not being targeted?
Curious what the stats look like this year so far for the ball heading his way.
Yeah, he's not getting attacked as much, but he's still kicking himself for the pick he missed at New Orleans.
He was looking at the end zone on that one.
I don't have any stats in front of me as far as how often he's been targeted, but with any corner, when you have a chance to get your hands on the ball, you have to cash in.
It might only be once every two weeks, but the great ones make those plays.
If ﻿Kevin King﻿ can't go, do you see Jaire matched up on Evans?
Hoping Godwin doesn't come back this week because I don't trust Jackson that much.
That'll be an interesting decision.
There are always two schools of thought.
You can put your best guy on their best guy, or you can count on your best guy to shut someone else down by himself and keep a safety over the top of their best guy for help.
What will your setup look like on Sunday?
Are you and Wes both going to be at Lambeau (working in separate rooms with the same TV broadcast that we see)?
Exactly.
We use different conference rooms that have big screens, and we have our laptops set up to work through the game.
He's doing the quarter by quarter story updates and I'm live-blogging the whole game.
Then we go through the Zoom press conferences afterward before returning to our desks to write our postgame stories.
It's election season, and with all the toxicity I'm trying to be positive and collaborative, but is it ok if I still hate the Bears?
That's allowed.
Joining late after a zoom meeting, so you may have answered this already.
Does Tampa Brady make you as nervous as NE Brady would have in the past?
I put nothing past Brady.
I don't know if he's had a receiver as good as Evans to work with since Randy Moss was in New England.
You know he's angry about how last week's game ended, especially with the biggest mistakes being his own.
The Packers have a chance to make the Bucs 3-3.
I suggest they take advantage of the opportunity.
Does live blogging from a TV broadcast help with incoming questions being that you are seeing the same footage as we are?
It helps to keep things more in sync timing-wise, but I don't get to see as much of the field and other things going on as I do from the press box.
It's looking inevitable that the league will eventually have to add weeks to the season if they want to play a full schedule.
Is there any way to do so and keep the drama of a 2010s-style Week 17?
Probably not.
But the league is going to hold out as long as it can before adding the Week 18.
Seems like the Bears have been absurdly lucky but in your view is there anything " there" over there to worry about?
That defense seemed to settle in during the second half last Thursday, and Foles is capable of playing way better than he has so far.
All right, I have to sign off now.
Thanks for all the participation folks and enjoy the rest of your week.
Take care and stay safe.
Best, Mike

Packers.com consulted more than a dozen mock drafts from reputable national outlets and compiled a list of players most frequently mocked as draft selections in the bottom third of the first round (picks 20-32).
Between now and draft day, when the Packers are slated to select at No.
29 overall, those players will be profiled with thumbnail sketches in a new series entitled "Draft Digest."
Today's player is …
Nick Bolton, LB, Missouri
Height/Weight: 6-0, 232
Key stats: Compiled 202 total tackles over the past two years, including 15 for loss and three sacks.
Also had two interceptions, one returned for a TD, and 12 passes defensed.
College honors: Twice named first-team All-Southeastern Conference by both league's coaches and media, and chosen second-team All-American by The Associated Press in 2020.
Background: The son of a Louisiana Tech football alum (Carlos), Bolton has been a linebacker throughout his career.
He played as a true freshman at Missouri and then became a full-time starter in 2019, emerging as an SEC star, leading the conference in tackles per game.
As a Butkus Award finalist and second-team All-American last season, Bolton has risen up draft boards as high as the bottom of the first round, though projections also have him as low as a late Day 2 selection, mostly because he's undersized.
There are questions about his coverage skills, but his pursuit and tackling stand out most on film.
He ran a 4.6 40 at Missouri's pro day with 24 bench-press reps at 225 pounds and a 32-inch vertical jump.
Potential fit with Packers: For now, Green Bay has turned over its two inside linebacker spots to ﻿Krys Barnes﻿ and ﻿Kamal Martin﻿, but that doesn't mean another young contender for playing time like Bolton won't be brought into the mix.
The undrafted Barnes was the better of the two rookies in 2020, with the fifth-round pick Martin also flashing plenty of potential.
Both battled injuries at different times, so nothing with the lineup is set in stone, and spending a high draft pick on Bolton would throw him right into the competition for a starting job in new coordinator Joe Barry's defense.
As the Packers look to upgrade their special teams under that phase's new coordinator, Maurice Drayton, a tackler like Bolton would be expected to contribute immediately.
Speedster's explosive playmaking was on display in 2020

Hey everybody.
Merry Christmas a couple of days early.
Hope everyone is healthy and well.
Thanks for logging on an hour earlier than normal.
The team has a different schedule this week so I had to adjust.
Let's get started.
How is it possible that a running back that got 18 yards on his first carry early in the second quarter never gets another carry in that game?
Did ﻿AJ Dillon﻿ get hurt?
No, but I think LaFleur made it pretty clear he regrets not running the ball more, and that would have included more action for Dillon with ﻿Jamaal Williams﻿ out of the game.
Happy Festivus!
Back at you.
But let's not make today's chat an airing of grievances, OK?
At least not too many.
If the Packers have the bye secured with a win over the Titans do they rest some starters against the Bears?
We'll see if that's a discussion for next week.
It might be, it might not be.
No point in pondering it now.
Can't wait for ﻿Tyler Ervin﻿ or ﻿Tavon Austin﻿ to get more involved again.
That extra dimension's been missing.
Yeah, there was very little jet motion used in the last game, so we'll see if LaFleur employs it more against Tennessee.
Austin could become the main guy for those duties with Swerve on IR.
Hi Mike.
Just wondering, what do you think the odds are we see a lot of ﻿Jaire Alexander﻿/﻿Kevin King﻿ on an island a lot this weekend so we can afford more resources to slowing down the monster that is King Henry?
Well, I don't see the Packers playing with no safeties back, but devoting one extra body to the run game is probably in order at some point.
This Tennessee offense makes you defend everybody.
The stats at RB, QB, WR all reflect that.
Does ﻿Christian Kirksey﻿ begin to see less playing time.
And how has ﻿Kamal Martin﻿ been in his rookie season?
We're seeing ﻿Krys Barnes﻿ and Martin used more lately.
Martin just flies around all over the place, almost looking out of control at times.
Barnes really played well vs. Carolina, and not just on the fumble play.
I think Kirksey has actually played better with a lesser snap load.
It's a good situation.
Hi Mike, Read the breakdown of all the stats comparing Engram and ﻿Robert Tonyan﻿.
Engram has been Bad this season!
I can understand Hockenson but how on earth can the voters put in Engram?
Who are those voters?
Engram over Tonyan makes no sense.
it just doesn't.
As a reader said in Inbox this morning, we don't need to spend any more time on it.
What happens if the Packers are in a 3-way tie at 12-4 with NO and SEA for the 1 seed?
I believe it depends if the Packers' 12th win is against Tennessee or Chicago.
If it's against the Bears, the Packers get the 1.
I hate looking forward to the offseason, but the cap is looming.
Do you forsee the NFL raising the cap to 200 million instead of the 175 million?
No, the $175 million is the floor for the cap and it sounds like it's staying there.
As I've been saying all season, it's going to be a difficult situation for everyone to deal with.
I remember my first time to Lambeau with my dad during a shareholder's event.
He was in a wheelchair at the time, and we were blown away by the history and kindness of everything and everyone we encountered.
Here's to hoping we can have a normal 2021 where other kids can have their first Lambeau experience too.
Absolutely.
Hi Mike.
What do you think the limit of rushing yards Derrick Henry might gain in order to beat the Titans?
It's hard to put a number on it.
I don't think the Packers have to hold him under 100 or do anything magical, but I don't think they can let him average 6.5 per carry or anything like that, either.
It's going to come down to the defense getting a key stop or two, however it does so -- turnover, big sack, stopping Henry on a key short-yardage play.
Whatever.
That's how I see it.
When is ﻿Corey Linsley﻿ available to come back from IR?
It would be nice to have him get some game reps before the playoffs.
Linsley returned to practice yesterday, so he's eligible to return.
Whether or not he's going to play Sunday night, we don't know for sure yet.
With the NFL allowing teams to (virtually) interview coaching candidates starting today, who on the GB staff might be getting a call soon?
I think Coach Hackett could get some head-coaching looks at some point.
I'm not sure about this year.
He might need to be an OC where he calls plays, like LaFleur did in Tennessee, to take that next step, I don't know.
Hey Mike, there appear to be 9 or 10 teams in the NFC playoff hunt right now.
Which appear to be the hottest teams heading into late December?
I don't think anyone in the NFC qualifies as really hot right now.
Everyone in the playoff hunt except the Packers has lost a game in the last three weeks, and GB had three pretty tight wins against sub-.500 teams.
No one in the NFC is the "it" team right now.
Everyone's had their lulls and struggles here and there.
If the Packers beat the Titans on Sunday night, I think a lot more attention comes GB's way, for whatever it's worth.
Weather has been mentioned as an advantage for us going forward but do you think that our team has really been exposed to the cold enough to make that big of a difference?
It's more about practicing in it regularly, which the Packers do.
Nobody plays flawlessly in the cold weather, but teams that aren't used to it might make one or two more mistakes in a game -- a dropped pass, or losing the handle on a run -- that you hope the Packers wouldn't make.
Until this morning's Insider Inbox, I was completely unaware of the Titans' passing success this year.
This matchup is going to be a fun challenge for the Packers, even at Lambeau.
And the Packers' running game is as underrated as the Titans' passing game.
These two offenses are pretty complete.
I've been watching NFL for about 60 years and the stiff arm has been around for much longer.
It's always been used to hold off would-be tacklers.
Derrick Henry is the first player I've ever seen that truly uses it as a Weapon meant to punish the defender.
What other backs have you seen whose stiff-arm might compare?
I'm with you, I'm not sure I've ever seen a back use it the way Henry does.
Guys like Earl Campbell, Emmitt Smith, Adrian Peterson all used it to a certain extent, but not like Henry.
It's just another element that makes him special.
I say give Henry his yards.
Key will be clock control, fundamentals/situational football, and turnovers.
Can't whiff on possessions.
Going to need points.
The Packers are going to have to get back to scoring 30-plus in this game, I think.
They've done it 10 of 14 times, and they've only been beaten once when they scored 30-plus, and that was OT at Indy.
Why do you think the offense has been so ineffective at making in game offensive adjustments?
The opposing defenses adjust and our offense just seems to fade away.
I understand this last game was frustrating in that regard, and it wasn't the first time this has happened, but I don't see this as some horribly troubling trend.
Just the week before, they came out in the second half and put together two clock-eating full-field drives for TDs vs. the Lions.
Before that, they came out to start the second half and ran the point total vs. the Bears up to 41.
I just don't buy the "adjustments" narrative because of a couple of games.
Might the best way to 'defend' against Henry is to get off to a fast start.
Make them play from behind - requiring more passing, less running?
They're not going to abandon the run game and Henry just because of a fast start, but you certainly don't want to get multiple scores behind where their running game can control the clock and limit your possessions to rally.
Any word on Jamaal Williams' status?
He did not practice yesterday.
That's all I know.
Home field advantage is about so much more than the fans and the weather.
I'm not sure why this is so misunderstood.
Agreed.
Not having to travel late in the year when the players' bodies are all beat up and run down matters, too.
If we happen to win the coin toss would you defer or take the ball Mike?
I'm always a fan of deferring.
The game to me is almost never won or lost in the first half.
AJ Dillon has some pretty mean stiff arms on his Boston College highlight reel.
Just sayin!
Maybe he'll bust one out this week.
In ﻿Aaron Rodgers﻿ (and Matt) we trust.
With the Titans defense deficiencies, those two will figure bit out.
W. Ed got the weapons.
I agree.
I think the Packers can have a big night on offense.
Mike, it would seem Green Bay has at the minimum Four games to make it to Super Bowl.
Do you think the players see it that way right now while in good health?
I don't think they'll be looking at it that way unless and until they get the No.
1 seed secured.
Without that, you're looking at having to win three playoff games, and probably at least one of them on the road, to get to the Super Bowl.
Rodgers ability to read a defense and put the offense in the correct position, his cadence, and his ability to know when to not throw the ball is uncanny.
How much do MVP voters factor this in?
The MVP is about putting up big stats that leads your team to great success.
That's the simplest way I can put it.
I don't think a whole lot else factors in, really.
If ML sticks with a balanced run game, do you AJ Dillon can wear down the titans D in the 2nd half?
He's a load.
Tennessee defensively has been much better against the run than against the pass this year, but you're right in that a balanced approach is when GB's offense is at its best, regardless of the opponent.
IMHO I think stopping the Titans run game is gonna take a total commitment from the D regardless of down and distance for all four quarters.
If Pettine and Lafleur feel the same what will that total commitment look like.
i.e.
What keys should I be looking for?
It's all about how many guys can beat their block and get to the ball.
If you're constantly asking one guy to tackle Henry because no one else can get off their blocks, he's gonna gash you.
Get lots of hats to the ball.
That's what it's all about.
Is the NFL concerned at all about the Repercussions of a lowered cap?
It's up to the teams to figure it out.
The structure moving forward is what the owners and players agreed to in negotiations before the COVID season started.
Mike, I'm buying a home for the first time, and it's exciting but scary.
Any advice for first time home buyers?
Take a fixed interest rate.
Henry over/under 125 rushing yds?
﻿Aaron Jones﻿ over/under 100 total yards?
Gambling is illegal at Bushwood, but I think the over on both of those is a decent bet.
If the Packers hold Henry under 125, their chances of winning go way up.
Tight ends seem to take longer to develop than those at other positions.
If true, what makes the transition more difficult?
Usually tight ends coming out of college are good at one thing -- either blocking or running routes/catching passes.
They have to become more efficient in the other element when they get to the NFL, and the responsibilities play after play increase along with that.
I vaguely recall that we picked up a player very late in the season of our last SB win.
If I am correct about that do you see any options for someone like that being available Mike?
It's getting a little too late for that.
If you're thinking of Howard Green from 2010, the Packers signed him in late October.
In case Seahawks lose before our game, would you, as Play caller, be very aggressive in this game and go for it on fourth down.
Knowing you have another swing next week?
I don't think anyone looks at it that way.
You have a plan for what you think it'll take to win the game.
Those fourth-down decisions are made in the moment, based on flow of the game, situation, etc.
I'm encouraged by Lafleur's words about needing to stay more committed to the run.
I think it can be a positive lesson heading into this Sunday's matchup.
He's always very introspective, and I don't think the talk is lip service.
The lack of commitment to the run last week was on both him and Rodgers.
I'm sure they've had discussions.
Rodgers' words yesterday to the media indicate he's given it plenty of thought after watching/reviewing the film too.
Definitely some exciting possible Week 17 matchups: Cowboys/Giants, Browns/Steelers.
Which games do you think will be the most dramatic for the playoff picture?
If Brown-Steelers is for the AFC North title, that would be a classic Week 17 matchup.
Two old rivals like that.
All right folks, I've got to sign off because we've got some media sessions coming up shortly.
Sorry to cut this short.
But thanks for all the participation, and we'll talk again next week.
Have a Merry Christmas, everyone.
Take care, Mike

Bengals HC Zac Taylor & GM Duke TobinVikings GM Rick Spielman Packers GM Brian Gutekunst
in attendance at Oregon Pro Day
— Taylor Bisciotti (@TaylorBisciotti) April 2, 2021
Brian Gutekunst’s pro-day tour took a stop in Oregon on Friday.
The Green Bay Packers general manager was in Eugene to check in on the Ducks’ prospects in the 2021 NFL draft, according to Taylor Bisciotti of NFL Network.
The main attraction at the pro day was offensive tackle Penei Sewell, who is expected to be a top pick.
Safety Jevon Holland, cornerback Thomas Graham Jr., safety Brady Breeze, cornerback Deommodre Lenoir, tight end Hunter Kampmoyer and defensive tackles Austin Faoliu and Jordon Scott all participated in the workout in front of NFL scouts and decision-makers.
Holland is one of the top safeties in the draft class and a potential fit for the Packers defense as a dime linebacker option.
The Packers already met virtually with Graham, continuing a trend of the team’s interest in cornerbacks.
According to Tony Pauline of Pro Football Network, Holland was the team’s primary target, but Lenior and Graham Jr. also spent time with Gutekunst.
Packers GM Brian Gutekunst was on hand for Oregon pro day.
I'm told the target was Jevon Holland but the Packers also spent time with Deommodore Lenoir and Thomas Graham Jr.
— Tony Pauline (@TonyPauline) April 2, 2021
There’s next to no chance that Sewell will fall out of the top 10 picks and into the Packers’ range.
Holland is super intriguing as a potential Day 2 pick for the Packers, especially considering his versatility, and it’s looking more and more likely that the team will use at least one or two picks on a cornerback, making Graham or Lenoir a real possibility.

Free agent offensive lineman Lane Taylor visited his second team since the start of the new league year.
According to the league's transaction wire, Taylor – a starter for the Green Bay Packers to open the 2020 season – visited the Houston Texans on Monday.
Taylor visited the San Francisco 49ers last month.
Both teams likely want to check in on his recovery from the ACL injury he suffered in Week 1 of last year.
Taylor took a pay cut and returned to the Packers in 2020, and a strong summer earned him the starting job at right guard.
He was lost...
Daniel Jeremiah's latest mock draft for NFL.com has the Green Bay Packers getting help for the interior of the offensive line in the first round.
Jeremiah sent Alabama offensive lineman Landon Dickerson to the Packers at No.
29 overall.
From Jeremiah: "Dickerson is the best pure interior offensive linemen available.
I thought he might fall out of the first round after his ACL injury, but it appears his recovery is going smoothly.
He can step in following the departure of Corey Linsley."
Dickerson is Jeremiah's No.
40 overall prospect in the draft class, mostly due to injuries.
He suffered a torn...
The first episode of Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers hosting "Jeopardy!"
aired Monday.
The three-time MVP has nine more episodes airing over the next two weeks.
How did Rodgers do during his opening appearance?
It's time to go to the tape to evaluate the performance.
Here's a light-hearted breakdown of Rodgers' first episode as guest host (note: spoilers ahead):
– Solid intro.
Looks confident, ready for the moment.
Possibly too much swaying back and forth.
He might be fighting some nerves, and that's just fine.
– Terrific job reading the opening categories.
Noted the quotations, emphasized key or interesting words.

At the midseason point, there were three areas the Packers' defense wanted to improve to not only regain its swagger but also become the unit it felt it could be entering the 2020 season.
It had to cut down on explosive gains on the ground, do a better job of keeping the opposition out of its end zone and generate more takeaways.
After a strong December, the Packers' defense leaned on past lessons learned to survive a grueling battle with Chicago on Sunday and walk out of Soldier Field with a 35-16 victory.
The Bears ran 74 offensive plays, dominated time of possession (35:29-24:31) and stressed the Packers' gap discipline with how it deployed talented running back David Montgomery in the biggest game of the season for both teams.
And Green Bay passed that test in limiting Chicago to only 108 yards on 31 carries, holding its NFC North foe to 1-of-5 in the red zone and forcing two critical turnovers.
The Bears had one explosive gain – a 53-yard pass to Darnell Mooney in the second quarter – but Green Bay managed to hold them to a field goal.
"I think that goes with our defense in general," safety ﻿Adrian Amos﻿ said.
"We try not to make those same mistakes that we were making earlier in the year in the red zone.
I feel like we're getting better each and every week."
A week after containing All-Pro running back Derrick Henry, the Packers didn't afford Montgomery much traction, either.
After getting gashed by the Bears' 1,000-yard rusher on the first play of the teams' Week 12 matchup, Green Bay didn't allow Montgomery a carry of more than eight yards on Sunday.
The third-year running back found paydirt once, finishing the Bears' opening series with a 2-yard TD run up the middle, but Green Bay otherwise clamped down inside its own 20.
That included after ﻿Tavon Austin﻿ fumbled a punt return in the second quarter that gave Chicago the ball at the Green Bay 20.
The Bears went three-and-out and were forced to settle for a Cairo Santos 30-yard field goal.
The defense earned its first takeaway later in the quarter, with cornerback ﻿Jaire Alexander﻿ stripping tight end Cole Kmet of the football at the Chicago 22.
 "The one thing I'm really proud of our defense is we've challenged them in terms of running to the football, getting multiple hats at the point of attack, and I think our guys have answered that," LaFleur said.
"They're playing with more energy, more emotion, playing together, really focused on doing their 1/11th, doing their job at the best of their ability, so that's something we'll continue to stress, and I think our guys have really improved in that regard."
Linebacker ﻿Krys Barnes﻿ had a career-high 14 tackles and stopped several runners short of the first down.
The Bears endured due to a 4-for-4 streak on fourth-down conversions.
That trend stopped when nickel cornerback ﻿Chandon Sullivan﻿ broke up a pass for Allen Robinson in the flat for a turnover on downs early in the fourth quarter.
On the next series, Amos intercepted Trubisky to help seal the win.
It's been a rollercoaster season for the Packers' defense, but the gradual improvements it made throughout the course of the year made it possible for the Packers to finish inside the top 10 in total defense for the first time in a decade.
On the eve of the postseason, the unit feels it's peaking at the right time.
"We just stayed together," said Amos of the key to the defensive success.
"When there's adversity throughout the season, we have to stick together.
We figure things out.
Great communication between the leaders of the team, between the coaches, everybody just locking in and grinding each and every day, taking one step at a time.
I think that's helped us big-time."
Soldier Field hosted a Week 17 matchup between the Green Bay Packers and Chicago Bears on Sunday, Jan. 3, 2021.
'An unbelievable year:' After years of close calls, ﻿Davante Adams﻿ finally carved out his own piece of Packers history.
With six catches for 46 yards and a touchdown against the Bears, Adams broke Sterling Sharpe's franchise record for single-season receptions (115) while tying Sharpe's 26-year-old mark for TD catches in a season (18).
And Adams did it in only 14 games.
"It definitely feels good," Adams said.
"(I've) been putting in a lot of hard work and have come up short of a few different things in my career.
So, it feels good to be able to achieve that."
The Bears tried to take Adams out of the game early before the Packers began moving the four-time Pro Bowl receiver around more in the fourth quarter.
He tied Sharpe's receptions record on the first play of Green Bay's 12-play, 76-yard scoring drive before breaking it on a 7-yard pass on the very next play.
Quarterback ﻿Aaron Rodgers﻿ said he spoke with Adams after the game, reminding him of what he accomplished in practically 13½ games due to the hamstring injury he sustained against Detroit in Week 2.
"I said 13½ games and you just had the greatest season by a Packer receiver in history.
And I meant it," Rodgers said.
"And it got me emotional and it gets me emotional in this moment.
I just have a ton of respect and appreciation for him and what he's accomplished.
It's been an unbelievable year."
O-line continues to shine: An offensive line touted for its flexibility and resolve once again put its best foot forward despite the absence of All-Pro left tackle ﻿David Bakhtiari﻿, who suffered a season-ending knee injury in practice on Thursday.
With ﻿Billy Turner﻿ filling in at left tackle and veteran ﻿Rick Wagner﻿ handling the right side, Rodgers had plenty of time with which to work against the Bears' defense.
He was sacked just one time, bringing his season total to 20.
That's the fewest times Rodgers has been sacked during a 16-game regular season…by eight.
Aside from Bakhtiari, the Packers had some lingering questions going into the game with Wagner leaving last Sunday's win over Tennessee with a knee injury of his own that caused the eighth-year veteran to miss practice on Wednesday.
"I couldn't be more thankful or proud of the way those guys played today and against a really good pass rush," Rodgers said.
"Those guys, tackles are a quarterback's best friend a lot, and I'm just very thankful for those guys being pro's pros in the way they play.
Especially Rick, because his status has been kinda up in the air, backup, starter, banged up, comes back, just a pro's pro, a very steady guy.
I'm really happy he's ours."
One more first: ﻿Mason Crosby﻿ became the first kicker in team history to record a perfect season on field goals, converting all 16 of his attempts this season.
He didn't get an opportunity to add to that total against the Bears, but made five extra points.
