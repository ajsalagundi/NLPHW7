The 17th regular-season game is officially confirmed for the 2021 NFL season.
On Tuesday, league owners approved what the NFL is calling an “enhanced season structure” that will add a 17th game to the regular season for all teams, starting next season. Under the new format, the 17th game will feature NFC teams playing AFC teams based on division and finish within the division during the previous season.
The new schedule has the Green Bay Packers playing the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium for next season’s 17th game. The NFC North will play the AFC West in 2021, and both the Packers and Chiefs won their respective divisions last season.
The Packers last played the Chiefs in 2019. Kansas City has won the AFC during each of the last two seasons.
The matchup could provide a titanic quarterback battle between Aaron Rodgers and Patrick Mahomes.
Elsewhere in the NFC North, the Chicago Bears will play the Las Vegas Raiders, the Minnesota Vikings will play the Los Angeles Chargers, and the Detroit Lions will play the Denver Broncos.
The NFL has played 16 regular-season games per team since 1978.
The official schedule will be released later this year.
Packers opponents in 2021
Home: Chicago Bears, Detroit Lions, Minnesota Vikings, Cleveland Browns, Los Angeles Rams, Pittsburgh Steelers, Seattle Seahawks, Washington Football Team.
Away: Chicago Bears, Detroit Lions, Minnesota Vikings, Arizona Cardinals, Baltimore Ravens, Cincinnati Bengals, Kansas City Chiefs, New Orleans Saints, San Francisco 49ers.

Packers WR Davante Adams surprises alma mater with new uniforms, cleats




Zach Kruse 

March 30, 2021



Green Bay Packers receiver Davante Adams gave back to the high school that helped launch his football career.
With help from Wisconsin-based sports apparel supplier Eastbay, Adams surprised the football team at his alma mater in Palo Alto, California with new Jordan brand uniforms, cleats and shoes.
Adams said sports help unite communities and give kids an "escape" and an "outlet," providing the basis for him helping out his high school.
"Having Davante come back and give back is something they're going to remember the rest of their lives," Palo Alto coach Nelson Gifford said.

The addition of a 17th regular-season game in 2021 means the Green Bay Packers will play 10 games against 2020 playoff teams next season.

The Chiefs will join the Chicago Bears (twice), New Orleans Saints, Seattle Seahawks, Pittsburgh Steelers, Baltimore Ravens, Cleveland Browns, Los Angeles Rams and the Washington Football Team as playoff teams on the Packers' schedule in 2021.
Seven of the 10 teams finished above .500.

Value isn’t there for Packers to keep DL Dean Lowry




Brandon Carwile 

March 30, 2021



The decision to extend defensive end Dean Lowry is still baffling. The Green Bay Packers believed Lowry could replace Mike Daniels, but his impact hasn’t been anywhere close. We are one month away from the NFL draft, and Lowry still hasn’t been cut even though he will count $6.3 million towards the cap in 2021. For that kind of money, the value just isn’t there to pay Lowry for what he does on defense.
When the Packers did their first wave of cuts at the beginning of the offseason, they parted ways with right tackle Rick Wagner and inside linebacker...
