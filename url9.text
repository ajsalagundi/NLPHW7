The Packers are re-signing DT Tyler Lancaster, a source said. He was a restricted free agent but wasn’t originally tendered.
— Rob Demovsky (@RobDemovsky) March 30, 2021

The Green Bay Packers are bringing back one of the team’s untendered restricted free agents.
According to Rob Demovsky of ESPN, the Packers will re-sign defensive lineman Tyler Lancaster, who was an unrestricted free agent after not receiving a restricted tender before the new league year.
Signed as an undrafted free agent out of Northwestern in 2018, Lancaster has played in 43 games and been on the field for 1,003 defensive snaps for the Packers over the last three seasons.
The Packers have used Lancaster mostly as a rotational run-stuffing interior lineman. He has 79 tackles and 1.5 sacks in his NFL career.
Lacking depth and experience along the defensive line, the Packers picked bringing back Lancaster over signing an outside free agent.
Lancaster is the fourth player to re-sign with the Packers, joining running back Aaron Jones, cornerback Kevin King and tight end Marcedes Lewis.

With help from Wisconsin-based sports apparel supplier Eastbay, Adams surprised the football team at his alma mater in Palo Alto, California with new Jordan brand uniforms, cleats and shoes.
Adams said sports help unite communities and give kids an "escape" and an "outlet," providing the basis for him helping out his high school.

Zach Kruse 

March 30, 2021



The addition of a 17th regular-season game in 2021 means the Green Bay Packers will play 10 games against 2020 playoff teams next season.
The AFC champion Kansas City Chiefs were added to the Packers' list of opponents as part of the NFL's expansion to 17 games. The Chiefs will join the Chicago Bears (twice), New Orleans Saints, Seattle Seahawks, Pittsburgh Steelers, Baltimore Ravens, Cleveland Browns, Los Angeles Rams and the Washington Football Team as playoff teams on the Packers' schedule in 2021.
Seven of the 10 teams finished above .500.

Value isn’t there for Packers to keep DL Dean Lowry




Brandon Carwile 

March 30, 2021



The decision to extend defensive end Dean Lowry is still baffling. The Green Bay Packers believed Lowry could replace Mike Daniels, but his impact hasn’t been anywhere close. We are one month away from the NFL draft, and Lowry still hasn’t been cut even though he will count $6.3 million towards the cap in 2021. For that kind of money, the value just isn’t there to pay Lowry for what he does on defense.
When the Packers did their first wave of cuts at the beginning of the offseason, they parted ways with right tackle Rick Wagner and inside linebacker...
